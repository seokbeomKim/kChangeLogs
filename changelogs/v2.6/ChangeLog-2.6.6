Summary of changes from v2.6.5 to v2.6.6
============================================

<stevef@linux.local>
	Can not mount from cifs vfs client built with gcc 3.3.1 due to compiler optimization of unsafe global variable. Remove unsafe global variable.

<stevef@linux.local>
	Fix problem reconnecting additional mounts to the same server after
	session failure.

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	Fix invalid dentry when race in mkdir between two clients

<stevef@linux.local>
	fix oops in send_sig on unmount of cifs vfs due to sending signal to demultiplex thread after it has exited.  
	Do not treat invalid handle warning in response to oplock break (of file that is now closed) as an error.

<stevef@linux.local>
	Fix EIO caused by network timeouts on changing file size.  
	To avoid spurious oplock breaks from server, in the case
	of inodes that we already have open, avoid doing path
	based setting of file size if we can do it by handle.
	This keeps our caching token (oplock) and avoids
	timeouts when the local oplock break takes longer to flush
	writebehind data than the SMB timeout for the SetPathInfo 
	request would allow

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	fix to not retime out the same session twice since it can invalidate the newly reestablished session unnecessarily

<stevef@smfhome.smfdom>
	Do not return buffer if request has already timed out.

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	move bad smb session retry to correct location, up one level in cifs vfs code

<stevef@steveft21.austin.ibm.com>
	fix endian bug in lockingX and add retry on EAGAIN

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	have to reconnect open files safely, one at a time, as needed

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	finish off move from reopening all files on reconnection (which takes too long under heavy stress) to reopen file as needed after reconnection to server.

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	correct retry on remaining handles based calls

<stevef@steveft21.austin.ibm.com>
	Fix compile error

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	Missing soft vs. hard retry mount option

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	Do not grab i_sem (already taken in filemap.c across commit write calls) during reopen of invalidated file handle.

<stevef@linux-udp14619769uds.austin.ibm.com>
	Fix oops in mount error path when unload_nls called with bad pointer.

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	Avoid smb data corruption under heavy stress

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	missing message on timed out requests

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	rcvtimeout set improperly for some cifs servers

<stevef@steveft21.ltcsamba>
	invalidate locally cached pages when server breaks oplock.  Do not loop reconnecting for servers that drop tcp session rather than sending smb negprot response

<stevef@steveft21.ltcsamba>
	Oops on reopen files when dentry already freed

<stevef@steveft21.ltcsamba>
	invalidate cached pages when last local instance closed so we do
	not use stale data while someone may be modifying the file on the
	server.

<stevef@steveft21.ltcsamba>
	fix double incrementing of transaction counter

<stevef@steveft21.ltcsamba>
	Fix check of filldir return code during readdir to avoid incomplete search results displayed on very large directories. Fix cleanup of proc entries.  Add config parm to allow disabling negotiating Linux extensions 

<stevef@steveft21.ltcsamba>
	allow disabling cifs Linux extensions via proc

<stevef@steveft21.ltcsamba>
	Fix an incorrect mapping of open flags to cifs open disposition.  Fix blocking byte range locks.  These fix breakages that were notice running lock tests 1 and 7 of the connectathon posix file api tests

<stevef@steveft21.ltcsamba>
	set byte range locktimeouts properly

<stevef@steveft21.ltcsamba>
	fix cifs readme

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	gracefully exit on failed mounts to win98 (which closes tcp session rather than erroring on smb protocol negotiation)

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	fix failed mounts to win98 part II

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	Fix global kernel name space pollution

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] Conversion of Rx/Tx descriptors to consistent DMA:
	- use pci_alloc_consistent() for Rx/Tx descriptors in rtl8169_open()
	  (balanced by pci_free_consistent() on error path as well as in
	  rtl8169_close());
	- removal of the fields {Rx/Tx}DescArrays in struct rtl8169_private
	  as there is no need to store a non-256 bytes aligned address any more;
	- fix for rtl8169_open() leak when RxBufferRings allocation fails.
	  Said allocation is pushed to rtl8169_init_ring() as part of an evil
	  cunning plan.

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] Conversion of Rx data buffers to PCI DMA
	- endianness is kept in a fscked state as it is in the original code
	  (will be adressed in a later patch);
	- rtl8169_rx_clear() walks the buffer ring and releases the allocated
	  data buffers. It needs to be used in two places: 
	  - rtl8169_init_ring() failure path;
	  - normal device release (i.e. rtl8169_close);
	- rtl8169_free_rx_skb() releases a Rx data buffer. Mostly an helper
	  for rtl8169_rx_clear(). As such it must:
	  - unmap the memory area;
	  - release the skb;
	  - prevent the ring descriptor from being used again;
	- rtl8169_alloc_rx_skb() prepares a Rx data buffer for use.
	  As such it must:
	  - allocate an skb;
	  - map the memory area;
	  - reflect the changes in the ring descriptor.
	  This function is balanced by rtl8169_free_rx_skb().
	- rtl8169_unmap_rx() simply helps with the 80-columns limit.
	- rtl8169_rx_fill() walks a given range of the buffer ring and
	  try to turn any descriptor into a ready to use one. It returns the
	  count of modified descriptors and exits if an allocation fails.
	  It can be seen as balanced by rtl8169_rx_clear(). Motivation:
	  - partially abstract the (usually big) piece of code for the refill
	    logic at the end of the Rx interrupt;
	  - factorize the refill logic and the initial ring setup.
	- simple conversion of rtl8169_rx_interrupt() without rx_copybreak
	  (will be adressed in a later patch).

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] rtl8169_start_xmit fixes:
	- it forgot to update stats if the skb couldn't be expanded;
	- it didn't free it either if the descriptor was not available;
	- move the spin_unlock nearer of the exit point instead of duplicating
	  it in the new branch.

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] Conversion of Tx data buffers to PCI DMA:
	- endianness is kept in a fscked state as it is in the original code
	  (will be adressed in a later patch);
	- buf_addr of an unmapped descriptor is always set to the same value 
	  (cf rtl8169_unmap_tx_skb);
	- nothing fancy, really.

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] Rx copybreak for small packets.
	- removal of rtl8169_unmap_rx() (unneeded as for now).

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] Add {mac/phy}_version.
	- change of identification logic in rtl8169_init_board();
	- {chip/rtl_chip}_info are merged in rtl_chip_info;
	- misc style nits (lazy braces, SHOUTING MACROS from realtek converted to
	  functions).

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] Merge of changes done by Realtek to rtl8169_init_one():
	- phy capability settings allows lower or equal capability as suggested
	  in Realtek's changes;
	- I/O voodoo;
	- no need to s/mdio_write/RTL8169_WRITE_GMII_REG/;
	- s/rtl8169_hw_PHY_config/rtl8169_hw_phy_config/;
	- rtl8169_hw_phy_config(): ad-hoc struct "phy_magic" to limit duplication
	  of code (yep, the u16 -> int conversions should work as expected);
	- variable renames and whitepace changes ignored.

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] Merge of timer related changes from Realtek:
	- changed their timeout value from 100 to HZ to trigger rtl8169_phy_timer();
	- s/TX_TIMEOUT/RTL8169_TX_TIMEOUT/ to have RTL8169_{TX/PHY}_TIMEOUT.

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] Merge of changes from Realtek:
	- register voodoo in rtl8169_hw_start().

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] Driver forgot to update the transmitted bytes counter.
	Originally done in rtl8169_start_xmit() by Realtek.

	[netdrvr r8169] Modification of the interrupt mask (RealTek).

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] Suspend/resume code (Fernando Alencar Marótica).

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] fix RX
	
	Brown paper bag time: the Rx descriptors are contiguous and EORbit only
	marks the last descriptor in the array. OWNbit implicitly marks the end
	of the Rx descriptors segment which is owned by the nic.

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] Endianness update (original idea from Alexandra N. Kossovsky):
	- descriptors status (bitfields enumerated as _DescStatusBit);
	- address of buffers stored in Rx/Tx descriptors.

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] Stats fix (Fernando Alencar Marótica <famarost@unimep.br>).

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[netdrvr r8169] fix TX race
	
	- possible tx descriptor index overflow (assume tp->dirty_tx = NUM_TX_DESC/2,
	  tp->cur_tx = NUM_TX_DESC - 1 and watch TxDescArray for example);
	- the status of an inadequate descriptor is checked.

<stevef@stevef95.austin.ibm.com>
	Relax requested CIFS permissions on open to simply request GENERIC_READ and GENERIC_WRITE (instead of GENERIC_ALL which

	[netdrvr r8169] Rx wrap bug:
	- rtl8169_rx_interrupt() can wrap and process an Rx descriptor that it has
	  invalidated a few iterations before. The patch limits the number of
	  allowed descriptors between two invocations of the Rx refill function;
	- rtl8169_rx_interrupt() now looks similar to rtl8169_tx_interrupt to
	  highlight the issue.

<James.Bottomley@steeleye.com>
	[PATCH] Fix error handler offline behaviour
	
	No-one seems to have noticed, but there's a bug in our offline handling
	which can cause the eh to loop forever when it tries to offline a device
	(basically offline I/O rejections are done in prep, which doesn't work
	for already prepped commands).
	
	The attached fixes this, and also sweeps offline up into a fairly fully
	fledged scsi state model.
	
	With this applied I can now offline my root device under load without
	causing a SCSI hang (ext2 BUG()s rather unhappily but at least that's
	not a SCSI problem).

<markh@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] aacraid reset handler update
	
	This is an update from the Adaptec version of the driver to the aacraid

	[TG3]: Jumbo frames and FTQ reset patch.
	
	1. Set extended packet length bit in phy register 0x18 shadow register 0
	on all chips that support jumbo frames (i.e. all chips except 5705 and
	its variants). Jumbo frame reception is less reliable (more CRC errors)
	if this bit is not set. This bit can be set regardless of the current
	MTU setting.
	
	
	2. Remove FTQ reset during chip init. This is the best fix for the ASF
	race condition problem that I mentioned a few months ago. The FTQ reset
	is redundant as it is already reset during GRC reset.
	

<davem@nuts.davemloft.net>
	[TG3]: Just completely delete the disabled FTQ reset code.

	[CPUFREQ] If ->init fails, unregister cpufreq driver.
	Some cpufreq drivers can only tell whether they work while the per-CPU

	[CPUFREQ] Merge ACPI perflib.
	Use ACPI _PSS data to determine valid frequency and voltage pairs on Enhanced

	[PATCH] I2C: w83781d fan_div code refactoring
	
	Quoting myself:
	
	> This tends to increase the size of the three set_store_regs_fan_div
	> functions, and I am considering refactoring them at some point. Later
	> though.
	
	Here is the promised refactoring. Tested on my AS99127F rev.1, seems to
	work. As for the previous patch, there is a part that I cannot test with
	the AS99127F, so additional testing is welcome.
	
	I agree this makes the code slightly less readable, but this saves 60
	lines of code (1754 bytes, around 3% of the driver total), and is
	actually far less complex that I first feared.

	driver (an I/O expander for the I2C bus). I have ported it from the 2.4
	version, and it includes some fixes and simplifications.
	
	It has been reviewed by Jean Delvare on IRC.

	[PATCH] QIC-02 tape drive hookup to classes in sysfs
	
	Here is a patch to hook up the qic02 tape device to have class
	support in sysfs. I have verified it compiles. I do not have access to
	the hardware to test. Could someone who does please verify?
	
	 From the file:
	 * This is a driver for the Wangtek 5150 tape drive with
	 * a QIC-02 controller for ISA-PC type computers.
	 * Hopefully it will work with other QIC-02 tape drives as well.

	[PATCH] More domain validation fixes and additions
	
	Following testing in more extreme situations, the following problems
	turned up:
	
	- The error handler can offline the device during DV (most particularly
	true when transport parameters are undetectably mismatched).  Fixed by
	modifying the state model to allow this and then having DV set the
	device back online for the retry.
	
	- DV needs to be serialised.  Fixed by introducing a per device
	semaphore.
	
	- Cosmetically, it's nice to trigger DV from userland, so added a
	revalidate sysfs entry.

	The various ways you can send data to/from your ATA device is
	known as the ATA taskfile protocol:  PIO single sector, PIO

	Prior to this change, the data direction (read/write) was encoded
	implicitly into the ATA_PROT_xxx value itself.  This increased
	complexity in some areas, and inhibited flexibility in others.
	
	This change separates data direction from taskfile protocol, and also
	moves the data direction flag (ATA_QCFLAG_WRITE) down to a lower
	level (ATA_TFLAG_WRITE).

	[PATCH] USB: gadget zero does endpoint autoconfig
	
	Here's where all those preceding autoconfig patches start
	to fit together:  one gadget driver gets rid of almost all
	the controller-specific #ifdeffery.
	
	Two of the other gadget drivers can do the same thing,
	and just as easily:  file storage, and serial.  (I'll
	hope their maintainers do those changes though.)
	
	The "ether.c" gadget driver is a lot more complicated to
	do this way since it has to cope with some differences
	by switching to alternate protocols (CDC Ethernet vs
	a subset) and soon be able to handle RNDIS.  So that'll
	be a while yet.
	
	
	Gadget Zero learns to autoconfigure.
	
	    - Gets rid of remaining controller-specific #ifdeffery.  Now
	      hardware choices can be made at run time too (not just
	      compile time).
	
	    - Simplifies its use of the "DEBUG" CPP symbol.
	
	    - Force device to report itself consistently as self-powered.

	This adds some code that gadget drivers can call from

	Add endpoint autoconfiguration for gadget drivers.
	
	Endpoint selection is currently being done with conditional compilation.
	That doesn't look nice, but more importantly it doesn't work well with
	the model that some distributions won't be custom-matched to hardware.
	Say, a PDA distro running on iPaq (pxa2xx_udc) or Axim (mq11xx_udc).
	
	This code just makes it easier for drivers to match to hardware at
	run-time.  It's a convenience function for something they could have

	[PATCH] USB: Improve core/config.c error messages
	
	This patch improves error reporting in the configuration parsing routines.
	It also adds a few extra minor tweaks.
	
		#include linux/config.h and make the usual DEBUG settings
		available.
	
		Use the driver-model dev_xxx() macros for log output.
	
		Be much more explicit about the nature of errors, including
		configuration, interface, and altsetting numbers where
		appropriate.
	
		Log fatal problems as errors, non-fatal ones as warnings.
	
		Remove a #define'd constant that is already set in linux/usb.h.
	
		Fix some variables declared as pointer to char that really
		should be pointers to unsigned char.
	
		Replace a whole bunch of "out-of-memory" error messages with
		a single message.
	
		Wrap source lines that are longer than 80 columns (but not
		log output lines!).
	
		Clean up the logic for detecting errors when retrieving a
		configuration descriptor.
	
	Apart from the log messages themselves, this introduces no functional
	changes.

<stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
	[PATCH] USB: Code improvements for core/config.c
	
	This patch makes some improvements to the code in config.c.
	
		Create a subroutine to handle the repeated task of skipping
		forward to the next descriptor of a certain type.
	
		Remove some fairly useless debugging messages (they could
		never even have been enabled in the pre-as221 code).
	
		Verify that endpoint descriptors don't have an address
		equal to 0 (as well as not being above 15).
	
		Rename some local variables so they are a little more
		consistent and meaningful.
	
	Despite all the changes, the functionality should remain the same.
	Please apply.

	[PATCH] USB: Don't trust raw descriptor length in devioc.
	
	This is a very minor point, unlikely ever to come up.  But just in case...
	
	It's conceivable that a device might transmit different values for a
	configuration descriptor's wTotalLength the first time we ask for it (in
	order to get the length) and the second time (to get the entire
	descriptor).  Should that improbable event occur, the rawdescriptor buffer
	could be allocated using a size that's smaller than the length recorded in
	the rawdescriptor itself.  This patch protects devio.c against such a
	problem.
	
	If you feel this sequence of events is too unlikely to worry about, then
	don't bother to apply the patch.

<stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
	[PATCH] USB: UHCI: Do short packet detection correctly
	
	This patch makes some simple changes to the way the UHCI driver does short
	packet detection.  The current implementation is incorrect in several
	ways:
	
		The Short-Packet-Detect flag is set for OUT transfers, which
		yields undefined behavior according to the UHCI spec.
	
		It's not set for URBs with URB_SHORT_NOT_OK, which is just the
		opposite of what we want!  Those are the ones where short packets
		do matter.
	
		It is set for the last packet in a transfer, which causes an
		unnecessary pause in the data flow (except of course that the
		pause _is_ necessary when URB_SHORT_NOT_OK is set).
	
	The patch also implements the URB_NO_INTERRUPT flag for bulk transfers,
	which can help improve system performance by reducing interrupt overhead.

<stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
	[PATCH] USB: UHCI: Improved handling of short control transfers
	
	This patch simplies the way the UHCI driver handles short control
	transfers.  When a transfer is short the HC will stop handling that
	endpoint, and it's necessary to get it going again so that the status
	stage of the control transfer can take place.  Currently the driver does
	this by allocating a new QH for the transfer and setting its element
	pointer to point at the final status TD.  The old QH is recycled.  But
	it's not necessary to go to all that trouble; the element pointer in the
	original QH can be updated directly.
	
	Normally the element pointer is supposed to be owned by the HC, and it's
	not safe to just change its value since the HC may overwrite it at any
	time.  But when a transfer is stopped because of a short packet, the
	current TD is marked inactive and the HC will not update the element
	pointer.  To write an unchanged pointer value back to memory would be a
	waste of PCI bus cycles.  Now the UHCI spec doesn't say explicitly that an
	HC _can't_ do this, but I've tested both Intel and VIA hardware and
	neither of them does.
	
	As a side effect of this change, some of the code for removing QHs can be
	eliminated.

<stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
	[PATCH] USB: UHCI: Get rid of excessive spinlocks
	
	This patch introduces a major simplification into the UHCI driver by
	replacing its multiple spinlocks with a single one.  The protected area of
	code is slightly larger and there's more possibilities for contention on
	an SMP system, but I think that shouldn't be a problem.  Stephen Hemminger
	has been kind enough to test this on his SMP computer and he hasn't
	encountered any difficulties.

	which turned up a minor bug.  This fixes it:  don't try to
	free a network device that hasn't been registerd.

	[PATCH] USB: g_ether does endpoint autoconfig too
	
	Here's an update for the Ethernet gadget that corresponds
	to the earlier one for Gadget Zero ... it gets rid of almost
	all the remaining controller-specific #ifdefs in this driver.
	(And also lets the driver initialize using "dummy_hcd".)
	
	This is a significant step towards doing hardware-specific
	configuration at run time (or at least init-time) rather
	than compile time, but other patches will be needed to take
	it the rest of the way there.   (Especially considering the
	RNDIS support...)  The runtime footprint of the driver shrank
	a bit, mostly because things moved into the init section.

<stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
	[PATCH] USB: Add dummy_hcd to the main kernel
	
	This is a resubmission of as225, together with appropriate changes for the
	g_serial driver.  David Brownell's latest g_ether update makes it
	unnecessary to change that file or gadget_chips.h.
	
	
	
	dummy_hcd is simultaneously a host controller driver and a device
	controller driver.  It creates a simulated HC together with a simulated
	UDC plugged into it.  Gadget drivers can run under the simulated UDC and
	will appear as regular USB devices on the simulated HC.  The simulation is
	reasonably (although not totally) realistic.
	
	It's a wonderful tool for testing and developing gadget drivers without
	the need for lots of additional hardware: Both the host driver and the
	gadget driver can run on the same computer.  It's been available for quite
	some time in David's gadget-2.6 tree and it works well.  I couldn't have
	gotten the file-storage gadget running in any reasonable length of time
	without it.

	[PATCH] I2C: adm1021 (probably) does something VERY,VERY BAD
	
	Quoting myself:
	
	> 3* Drop adm1021's limit init. This was already done in the 2.4 driver
	> and should have been done in 2.6 as well.
	
	Here is a patch that does that. It also prevents bit 7 (and unused bits)
	of configuration register from being reset, as was discussed before:
	  http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg04593.html
	That second part needs to be backported to the 2.4 driver, and I will do
	so.
	
	Additionally, we get rid of a useless label.
	
	The patch is untested (I don't own any supported chip) but quite
	straightforward IMHO.

<khali@linux-fr.org>
	[PATCH] I2C: Setting w83627hf fan_div preserves fan_min
	
	Here is a patch that updates the w83627hf driver in the exact same way I
	did recently for the w83781d driver. There were two problems:
	1* Fan divisor storing code was ugly, badly ripped from the 2.4 w83627hf
	   driver and/or the 2.6 w83781d driver.
	2* Setting fan divisors wouldn't preserve fan mins.
	
	Exactly the same as w83781d:
	http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg06952.html
	http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg07008.html
	
	No surprise since the w83627hf driver is a fork of the w83781d driver.
	
	Since the two drivers are strongly similar, I took the code directly
	from the updated w83781d driver. I cannot test the w83627hf driver
	(testers welcome BTW) but this makes me feel confident that the code is
	correct.
	
	To make it clear, this single patch is the w83627f equivalent of the
	three patches I submitted for the w83781d:
	* Cleanup
	* Refactoring
	* Setting fan_div preserves fan_min
	All in one (much better looking BTW).

	PCI: add ability to access pci extended config space for PCI Express devices
	
	Patch originally written by Intel, cleaned up and made sane by

	From Matt's original email:
	 - Add cfg_size to struct pci_dev.
	 - Use it in sysfs and procfs.
	 - Introduce pci_find_ext_capability() for finding extended capabilities.
	 - Change the PCI_X_STATUS defines to match the spec (mea culpa there).

	[PATCH] PCI: Updates for PCI Express hot-plug driver

<willy@debian.org>
	[PATCH] PCI Hotplug: Don't up() twice in acpiphp
	
	On the error path, we currently try to up() a semaphore twice.
	There was also a typo in an error message.

<willy@debian.org>
	[PATCH] PCI Hotplug: Rewrite acpiphp detect_used_resource
	
	There are two unrelated problems in acpiphp that are fixed by this patch.
	First, acpiphp can be a module, so it is unsafe to probe the BARs of each
	device while it initialises -- the device may be active at the time.
	Second, it does not know about PCI-PCI bridge registers and so it reads
	garbage for the last 4 registers of the PCI-PCI bridge card and doesn't
	take into account the ranges that are forwarded by the bridge.
	
	This patch avoids all that by using the struct resources embedded in
	the pci_dev.  Note that we no longer need to recurse as all the devices
	on the other side of a PCI-PCI bridge have their resources entirely
	contained within the PCI-PCI bridge's ranges.

	 * Simpler/cleaner locking:  caller must own dev->serialize.
	
	 * Access from usbfs now uses usb_reset_configuration() sometimes,
	   preventing sysfs thrash, and warns about some dangerous usage
	   (which gphoto2 and other programs may be relying on).  (This is
	   from Alan Stern, but I morphed an error return into a warning.)
	
	 * Prevent a couple potential "no configuration" oopses. (Alan's?)

	   of usb_reset_device().  This should be more polite now, hanging

	We still must discuss what setup to use for readers like this -

	twice, once with CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DATAFAB defined and once
	without, and remove one usb-storage.ko and insert the other
	to go from CF to SM. (And that hangs with 2.6.4 so a reboot

	[PATCH] I2C: Prevent misdetections in adm1021 driver
	
	Yet another patch for the adm1021 chip driver. I refined the detection
	code a bit in order to prevent chip misdetection. Some chips handled
	by the adm1021 driver are hard to detect and identify (LM84 and
	MAX1617) so we tend to accept any chip it the valid I2C address range
	as one of these. It has caused much, much trouble already. See these
	threads for example:
	
	http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg04448.html
	http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg04624.html
	http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg05560.html
	http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg05871.html
	http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg06754.html
	http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg07181.html
	
	And this ticket:
	
	http://www2.lm-sensors.nu/~lm78/readticket.cgi?ticket=1434
	
	So I thought it would be good to prevent this kind of problems if
	possible, and read the 8 datasheets again in search for ways to refine
	the detection method.
	
	I changed it in sensors-detect already, and had positive feedback from
	one user. I will also backport the changes to the driver to the 2.4
	version we have in CVS.
	
	What the patch does:
	
	* Use unused bits of two more registers (configuration and conversion
	rate) to reduce misdetections.
	
	* Return with -ENODEV if the detection fails.
	
	* Change the order in which we try to identify the chips. We better
	finish with the LM84 and the MAX1617, in this order, because they are
	harder to identify and are more likely to result in false positives.
	
	* Refine LM84 detection. The LM84 has less features than the other
	chips(chip cannot be stopped, conversion rate cannot be set, no low
	limits) so it has extra unused bits.
	
	* Do not intialize the chip if it was detected as an LM84. This one
	cannot be stopped so why would we try to start it again? And as said
	right before, conversion rate isn't changeable either.
	
	Note that I couldn't test the changes on any supported chip since I
	don't own any. Still I believe that they should be applied, since the
	current code already broke one system and seriously harmed several
	others. I believe it's not critical if it turns out that we reject
	valid chips (which shouldn't happen if the datasheets are correct,
	anyway). People will simply let us know and we'll be less restrictive.
	In the meantime they can force the driver. That said, testers are
	welcome, as usual.

	Here's an updated patch, applies to 2.6.5-rc2-bk9.
	I left the DMA_xxBIT_MASK defines in linux/pci.h, although
	they aren't necessarily PCI-specific.  Would we prefer to
	have them in linux/dma-mapping.h ?

	[libata sata_via] Fix detection of device 1
	
	VIA hardware thinks port 1 (second port) is "SATA primary slave".
	Since the hardware rarely configures SATA to present as slave devices,
	we must pretend that the second hardware port (as the user sees it)
	is the third port (as the VIA PCI config registers see it).

	[PATCH] USB Gadget: Use configuration-buffer library in file-storage
	
	This patch imports the config-buffer library into the file-storage gadget,
	simplifying and decreasing the amount of code needed for assembling
	configuration descriptors.  It also changes the driver to remove any
	pretense at bus-powered operation and to use the new DUALSPEED
	configuration option.  This is in line with recent changes made to other
	gadget drivers.

	[PATCH] USB Gadget: Use automatic endpoint selection in file-storage

	almost all dependencies on the controller type from the driver.  It also
	changes some log messages for reporting fatal problems from INFO to ERROR.

	[PATCH] USB: Complete all URBs in UHCI when releasing the bus
	
	This patch changes the UHCI driver's bus-release routine; now it will

	reported bug, when trying to rmmod uhci-hcd while using a USB mouse under
	X.  Also, the patch changes a variable name from ...hs... to ...fs...
	("high speed" -> "full speed") -- something I accidentally omitted in an
	earlier patch.

	[PATCH] USB Gadget: Rename the dummy_hcd's gadget
	
	When David added an entry to the gadget_chips.h file for the dummy_hcd
	driver, he mistakenly used the name "dummy_udc" rather than "dummy_hcd".
	The mistake is understandable, since other controllers use "_udc" in their
	names and it is illogical to put "_hcd" in a _device_ controller's name.
	
	This patch updates the dummy_hcd driver and changes the gadget name to
	agree with the gadget_chips.h entry.

	[PATCH] PCI: Allow arch-specific pci_set_dma_mask and friends
	
	The patch provides the ability for architectures to have custom
	implementations of pci_set_dma_mask() and friends (dac_set_dma_mask
	and set_consistent_dma_mask). The reason I need this is b/c I have
	a chipset (Intel ARM IXP425) that has a broken PCI interface that
	only allows PCI dma to/from the bottom 64MB of system memory.  To get
	around this limitation, I trap a custom dma-mapping implementation that
	bounces buffers outside the 64MB window. At device discover time, my
	custom platform_notify() function gets called and it sets the dma_mask
	to (64MB-1) and in ARM's dma-mapping code, I check for dma_mask != 0xffffffff
	and if that is true, I call the special bounce helpers. This works great
	except that certain drivers (e100, ide-pci) call pci_set_dma_mask()
	with 0xffffffff and the generic implementation only allows for the
	architecture-defined pci_dma_supported() to return true or false. There
	is no method for the architecture to tell the PCI layer "I can't set
	the mask to 0xffffffff, but I can set it to this other value" and there
	is no way to pass that back to the driver. What this means is that if
	I have pci_set_dma_supported() return failure on full 32-bit DMA, the
	driver will not initialize the card; however, if I return true,
	pci_set_dma_mask() will set the dma mask to full 32-bits and I can no
	longer trap and will have buffers that are not dma-able and cause
	PCI master aborts.  Both of those are not acceptable.  IMHO, the
	driver shouldn't care if the architecture has to bounce DMA outside of
	64MB and since this is not something most architectures have to worry
	about, the easiest way to get around the issue is by allowing custom
	pci_set_dma_mask() for arches that need it but keeping the generic
	implementation for those that do not.  In my case, it simply returns
	0 to the driver but keeps the device mask set to 64MB-1 so I can trap.

	Get rid of some arbitrary API restrictions that limit the kernel

	Note: there still is limit of 256 ports due to STP, but this
	shouldn't show up in the API, it needs to be handled by the
	'add port to bridge ioctl'.

<shemminger@osdl.org>

	[CPUFREQ] Transmeta longrun driver fix.
	(From Stelian Pop)
	Upon investigation, the reason is that trying to set the performance
	to 80% in longrun_determine_freqs leaves the performance to 100%.
	The performance level, at least on this particular model, can be lowered
	only in 33% steps. And in order to put the performance to 66%, the
	code should try to set the barrier to 70%.
	                                                                                                           
	The following patch does even more, it tries every value from 80%
	to 10% in 10% steps, until it succeeds in lowering the performance.
	I'm not sure this is the best way to do it but in any case,
	it works for me (and should continue to work for everybody else).

	Networking support/options and Networking drivers have been, uhm,

	and I was already looking into options to clean it up.
	
	This is a cleanup of Networking support/options and Networking Drivers.
	It presents a more consistent interface and lists similar driver
	groups and protocol groups closer together.
	It also moves the IBMVETH driver so that it no longer breaks the
	dependency tree, allowing other drivers (nearby in Kconfig file)
	to be presented in a more linear manner.

	[Bluetooth] Fix URB unlink race in the USB drivers
	
	The code in hci_usb_unlink_urbs() calls usb_unlink_urb() to perform a

	completed list, and then frees everything on the completed list. By doing
	this, the code implicitly assumes that when usb_unlink_urb() returns the
	URB will have completed and be ready to be deallocated. That's not always
	true. The same applies to the BlueFRITZ! USB driver.

	[PATCH] ia64: perfmon update
	
	Here is a new perfmon patch. It is important because it
	fixes the problem of the close() when the file descriptor
	is shared between two related processes. The good thing
	is that it simplifies a lot the cleanup of the sampling
	buffer.
	
	Here is the ChangeLog:
	
	- fix bug in pfm_close() when the descriptor is
	  shared between related processed. Introduce
	  a pfm_flush() called for each invocation of
	  close(). pfm_close() only called for the last
	  user.
	
	- fix pfm_restore_monitoring() to also reload
	  the debug registers. They could be modified
	  while monitoring is masked.
	
	- fix pfm_close() to clear ctx_fl_is_sampling.
	
	- fix a bug in pfm_handle_work() which could cause
	  the wrong PMD to be reset. 
	
	- converted PROTECT_CTX/UNPROTECT_CTX into
	  local_irq_save/restore to keep context protection
	  but allow IPI to proceed.
	
	- updated pfm_syswide_force_stop() to use
	  local_irq_save/restore now that the context
	  is protected from the caller side.
	
	- updated pfm_mck_pmc_check() to check if context is 
	  loaded before checking for special IBR/DBR combinations.
	  Clearing the debug registers is not needed when the context
	  is not yet loaded.
	
	- updated perfmon.h to have to correct prototype definitions
	  for the pfm_mod_*() functions.
	
	- got rid of the PFM_CTX_TERMINATED state.
	
	- cleanup the DPRINT() statements to remove
	  explicit output of current->pid. This is done
	   systematically by the macros.
	
	- added a systctl entry (expert_mode) to bypass
	  read/write checks on PMC/PMD. As its name indicates
	  this is for experts ONLY. Must be root to toggle
	  /proc/sys entry.
	
	- corrected pfm_mod_*() to check against the current task.
	
	- removed pfm_mod_fast_read_pmds(). It is never needed.
	
	- added pfm_mod_write_ibrs() and pfm_mod_write_dbrs().

	[PATCH] I2C: Enable changing fan_divs in lm80 driver
	
	For some reason the original lm80 driver in 2.6 cannot set fan_divs
	(while the 2.4 driver could). This patch brings support back. It was
	lightly tested by one user.
	
	This patch also suggests some code cleanups (fan code refactoring). I'll
	send a different patch later for these.

	[PATCH] I2C: New chip driver: pcf8591
	
	Please find below a patch against kernel 2.6.5-rc2-mm4 to add the pcf8591
	driver (a 8-bit A/D and D/A converter). I have ported it from the 2.4
	version, and it includes some fixes, improvements and simplifications.
	
	It has been reviewed by Jean Delvare on IRC.
	
	Please also note that the patch also fixes a missing space in
	drivers/i2c/chips/Kconfig, introduced by the previous patch I sent you
	concerning the pcf8574.

	[PCMCIA] Fix resource handling for memory probe
	
	Add claim_region and free_region to claim/free resource regions.
	This ensures that we only attempt to probe memory regions which

	From: Olof Johansson <olof@austin.ibm.com>
	
	It's currently a boolean, but that means that system_running goes to zero

	is only designed to be used during bootup - it is marked __init.
	
	So we need to be able to distinguish early boot state from late shutdown
	state.  Rename system_running to system_state and give it the three
	appropriate states.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] con_open() speedup/cleanup
	
	con_open() is called on every open of the tty, even if the tty is already all
	set up.  We only need to do that initialisation if the tty is being set up
	for the very first time (tty->count == 1).
	
	So do that: check for tty_count == 1 inside console_sem() and if so, bypass
	all the unnecessary initialisation.
	
	
	
	Note that this patch reintroduces the con_close()-vs-init_dev() race+oops. 
	This is because that oops is accidentally prevented because when it happens,
	con_open() reinstalls tty->driver_data even when tty->count > 1.
	
	But that's bogus, and when the race happens we end up running
	vcs_make_devfs() and vcs_remove_devfs() against the same console at the same
	time, producing indeterminate results.
	
	So the race needs to be fixed again, for real.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] remove down_tty_sem()
	
	Remove the down_tty_sem() and up_tty_sem() and replace them with open-coded
	up() and down().  This is an equivalent transformation.
	
	I assume these functions were created to open the possibility of per-tty
	semaphores at some time in the future.  But the code which is protected by
	this lock deals with two tty's at the same time, and the next patch will need
	to release the lock after the tty has been destroyed.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] Fix VT open/close race
	
	The race is that con_close() can sleep, and drops the BKL while
	tty->count==1.  But another thread can come into init_dev() and will take a
	new ref against the tty and start using it.
	
	But con_close() doesn't notice that new ref and proceeds to null out
	tty->driver_data while someone else is using the resurrected tty.
	
	So the patch serialises con_close() against init_dev() with tty_sem.
	
	
	Here's a test app which reproduced the oops instantly on 2-way.  It realy
	needs to be run against all tty-capable devices.

	[PATCH] Fix get_wchan() FIXME wrt. order of functions
	
	From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
	
	This addresses the issue with get_wchan() that the various functions acting
	as scheduling-related primitives are not, in fact, contiguous in the text
	segment.  It creates an ELF section for scheduling primitives to be placed
	in, and places currently-detected (i.e.  skipped during stack decoding)
	scheduling primitives and others like io_schedule() and down(), which are
	currently missed by get_wchan() code, into this section also.
	
	The net effects are more reliability of get_wchan()'s results and the new
	ability, made use of by this code, to arbitrarily place scheduling
	primitives in the source code without disturbing get_wchan()'s accuracy.
	
	Suggestions by Arnd Bergmann and Matthew Wilcox regarding reducing the
	invasiveness of the patch were incorporated during prior rounds of review. 
	I've at least tried to sweep all arches in this patch.

	[PATCH] ppc64: Fix bug in hugepage support
	
	From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
	
	The PPC64 version of is_aligned_hugepage_range() is buggy.  It is supposed to
	test not only that the given range is hugepage aligned, but that it lies
	within the address space allowed for hugepages.  We were checking only that
	the given range intersected the hugepage range, not that it lay entirely
	within it.  This patch fixes the problem and changes the name of some macros
	to make it less likely to make that misunderstanding again.

	[PATCH] ppc64: hugepage bugfix
	
	From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
	
	Found this again while looking at hugepage extensions.  Haven't actually had
	it bite yet - the race is small and the other bug will never be triggered in
	32-bit processes, and the function is rarely called on 64-bit processes.
	
	This patch fixes two bugs in the (same part of the) PPC64 hugepage code.
	First the method we were using to free stale PTE pages was not safe with some
	recent changes (race condition).  BenH has fixed this to work in the new way.
	 Second, we were not checking for a valid PGD entry before dereferencing the
	PMD page when scanning for stale PTE page pointers.

	[PATCH] disable VT on iSeries by default
	
	From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
	
	This patch from Julie DeWandel makes CONFIG_VT default to N on iSeries
	machines which are using the iSeries virtual console driver viocons.c.  The
	VT console and the viocons code can't coexist because they use the same tty
	numbers, that is, viocons supplies /dev/tty1.  Without this patch the user
	has to figure out somehow that s/he has to turn on CONFIG_EMBEDDED in order
	to be able to turn off CONFIG_VT, which is really very non-obvious.

	[PATCH] ppc64: allow hugepages anywhere in low 4GB
	
	From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
	
	On PPC64, to deal with the restrictions imposed by the PPC MMU's segment
	design, hugepages are only allowed to be mapping in two fixed address
	ranges, one 2-3G (for use by 32-bit processes) and one 1-1.5T (for use in
	64-bit processes).  This is quite limiting, particularly for 32-bit
	processes which want to use a lot of large page memory.
	
	This patch relaxes this restriction, and allows any of the low 16 segments
	(i.e.  those below 4G) to be individually switched over to allow hugepage
	mappings (provided the segment does not already have any normal page
	mappings).  The 1-1.5T fixed range for 64-bit processes remains.

	[PATCH] ppc64: Move EPOW log buffer to BSS
	
	From: Olof Johansson <olof@austin.ibm.com>
	
	RTAS on IBM pSeries runs in real mode, so all pointers being passed in to
	it need to be in low memory.  There's two places in the RAS code that
	passes in pointers to items on the stack, which might end up being above
	the limit.
	
	Below patch resolves this by creating a buffer in BSS + a lock for
	serialization.  There's no reason to worry about contention on the lock,
	since rtas_call() also serializes on a single spinlock and this is an
	infrequent code path in the first place.

	[PATCH] search for /init for initramfs boots
	
	From: Olaf Hering <olh@suse.de>
	
	initramfs can not be used in current 2.6 kernels, the files will never be
	executed because prepare_namespace doesn't care about them.  The only way to
	workaround that limitation is a root=0:0 cmdline option to force rootfs as
	root filesystem.  This will break further booting because rootfs is not the
	final root filesystem.
	
	This patch checks for the presence of /init which comes from the cpio archive
	(and thats the only way to store files into the rootfs).  This binary/script
	has to do all the work of prepare_namespace().

	[PATCH] md: merge_bvec_fn needs to know about partitions.
	
	From: Neil Brown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
	
	Addresses http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2355
	
	It seems that a merge_bvec_fn needs to be aware of partitioning...  who
	would have thought it :-(
	
	The following patch should fix the merge_bvec_fn for both linear and raid0.
	We teach linear and raid0 about partitions in the merge_bvec_fn.
	
	->merge_bvec_fn needs to make decisions based on the physical geometry of the
	device.  For raid0, it needs to decide if adding the bvec to the bio will
	make the bio span two drives.
	
	To do this, it needs to know where the request is (what the sector number is)
	in the whole device.
	
	However when called from bio_add_page, bi_sector is the sector number
	relative to the current partition, as generic_make_request hasn't been called
	yet.
	
	So raid_mergeable_bvec needs to map bio->bi_sector (which is partition
	relative) to a bi_sector which is device relative, so it can perform proper
	calculations about when chunk boundaries are.

	[PATCH] posix message queues: code move

	cleanup of sysv ipc as a preparation for posix message queues:

	  CONFIG_SYSVIPC is set, use makefile magic instead of #ifdef.
	
	- remove the prototypes for copy_semundo and exit_sem from kernel/fork.c
	
	- they belong into a header file.
	
	- create a new msgutil.c with the helper functions for message queues.
	
	- cleanup the helper functions: run Lindent, add __user tags.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] posix message queues: syscall stubs
	
	From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
	
	Add -ENOSYS stubs for the posix message queue syscalls.  The API is a direct
	mapping of the api from the unix spec, with two exceptions:
	
	- mq_close() doesn't exist.  Message queue file descriptors can be closed
	  with close().
	
	- mq_notify(SIGEV_THREAD) cannot be implemented in the kernel.  The kernel
	  returns a pollable file descriptor .  User space must poll (or read) this
	  descriptor and call the notifier function if the file descriptor is
	  signaled.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] posix message queues: implementation
	
	From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
	
	Actual implementation of the posix message queues, written by Krzysztof
	Benedyczak and Michal Wronski.  The complete implementation is dependant on
	CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE.
	
	It passed the openposix test suite with two exceptions: one mq_unlink test
	was bad and tested undefined behavior.  And Linux succeeds
	mq_close(open(,,,)).  The spec mandates EBADF, but we have decided to ignore
	that: we would have to add a new syscall just for the right error code.
	
	The patch intentionally doesn't use all helpers from fs/libfs for kernel-only
	filesystems: step 5 allows user space mounts of the file system.
	
	
	
	Signal changes:
	
	The patch redefines SI_MESGQ using __SI_CODE: The generic Linux ABI uses
	a negative value (i.e.  from user) for SI_MESGQ, but the kernel internal
	value must be posive to pass check_kill_value.  Additionally, the patch
	adds support into copy_siginfo_to_user to copy the "new" signal type to
	user space.
	
	
	
	Changes in signal code caused by POSIX message queues patch:
	
	General & rationale:
	
	  mqueues generated signals (only upon notification) must have si_code
	  == SI_MESGQ.  In fact such a signal is send from one process which
	  caused notification (== sent message to empty message queue) to
	  another which requested it.  Both processes can be of course unrelated
	  in terms of uids/euids.  So SI_MESGQ signals must be classified as
	  SI_FROMKERNEL to pass check_kill_permissions (not need to say that
	  this signals ARE from kernel).
	
	  Signals generated by message queues notification need the same
	  fields in siginfo struct's union _sifields as POSIX.1b signals and we
	  can reuse its union entry.
	
	  SI_MESGQ was previously defined to -3 in kernel and also in glibc. 
	  So in userspace SI_MESGQ must be still visible as -3.
	
	Solution:
	
	  SI_MESGQ is defined in the same style as SI_TIMER using __SI_CODE macro.
	
	  Details:
	
	    Fortunately copy_siginfo_to_user copies si_code as short.  So we
	    can use remaining part of int value freely.  __SI_CODE does the
	    work.  SI_MESGQ is in kernel:
	
	 		6<<16 | (-3 & 0xffff) what is > 0
	
	    but to userspace is copied
	
	 		(short) SI_MESGQ == -3
	
	Actual changes:
	
	  Changes in include/asm-generic/siginfo.h
	
	  __SI_MESGQ added in signal.h to represent inside-kernel prefix of
	  SI_MESGQ.  SI_MESGQ is redefined from -3 to __SI_CODE(__SI_MESGQ, -3)
	
	  Except mips architecture those changes should be arch independent
	  (asm-generic/siginfo.h is included in arch versions).  On mips
	  SI_MESGQ is redefined to -4 in order to be compatible with IRIX.  But
	  the same schema can be used.
	
	  Change in copy_siginfo_to_user: We only add one line to order the
	  same copy semantics as for _SI_RT.
	
	  This change isn't very portable - some arch have its own
	  copy_siginfo_to_user.  All those should have similar change (but
	  possibly not one-line as _SI_RT case was sometimes ignored because i
	  wasn't used yet, e.g.  see ia64 signal.c).
	
	Update:
	mq: only fail with invalid timespec if mq_timed{send,receive} needs to block
	From: Jakub Jelinek <jakub@redhat.com>
	
	POSIX requires EINVAL to be set if:
	"The process or thread would have blocked, and the abs_timeout parameter
	specified a nanoseconds field value less than zero or greater than or equal
	to 1000 million."
	but 2.6.5-mm3 returns -EINVAL even if the process or thread would not block
	(if the queue is not empty for timedreceive or not full for timedsend).

	Make the posix message queue mountable by the user.  This replaces ipcs and

	I'd like a final confirmation from Ulrich that our SIGEV_THREAD approach is
	the right thing(tm): He's aware of the design and didn't object, but I think
	he hasn't seen the final API yet.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] posix message queue update
	
	From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
	
	My discussion with Ulrich had one result:
	
	- mq_setattr can accept implementation defined flags.  Right now we have
	  none, but we might add some later (e.g.  switch to CLOCK_MONOTONIC for
	  mq_timed{send,receive} or something similar).  When we add flags, we
	  might need the fields for additional information.  And they don't hurt.
	  Therefore add four __reserved fields to mq_attr.
	
	- fail mq_setattr if we get unknown flags - otherwise glibc can't detect
	  if it's running on a future kernel that supports new features.
	
	- use memset to initialize the mq_attr structure - theoretically we could
	  leak kernel memory.
	
	- Only set O_NONBLOCK in mq_attr, explicitely clear O_RDWR & friends.
	  openposix uses getattr, attr |=O_NONBLOCK, setattr - a sane approach. 
	  Without clearing O_RDWR, this fails.
	
	I've retested all openposix conformance tests with the new patch - the two
	new FAILED tests check undefined behavior.  Note that I won't have net
	access until Sunday - if the message queue patch breaks something important
	either ask Krzysztof or drop it.
	
	Ulrich had another good idea for SIGEV_THREAD, but I must think about it.
	It would mean less complexitiy in glibc, but more code in the kernel.  I'm
	not yet convinced that it's overall better.

	[PATCH] security bugfix for mqueue
	
	From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
	
	I found a security bug in the new mqueue code: a process that has only
	write permissions to a message queue could call mq_notify(SIGEV_THREAD) and
	use the returned notification file descriptor to read from the message
	queue.

	[PATCH] split netlink_unicast
	
	From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
	
	The attached patch splits netlink_unicast into three steps:
	
	- netlink_getsock{bypid,byfilp}: lookup the destination socket.
	
	- netlink_attachskb: perform the nonblock checks, sleep if the socket
	  queue is longer than the limit, etc.
	
	- netlink_sendskb: actually send the skb.
	
	jamal looked over it and didn't see a problem with the netlink change.  The
	actual use from ipc/mqueue.c is still open (just send back whatever the C
	library passed to mq_notify, add an nlmsghdr or perhaps even make it a
	specialized netlink protocol), but the attached patch is independant from
	the the message queue change.

	[PATCH] posix message queues: send notifications via netlink
	
	From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
	
	SIGEV_THREAD means that a given callback should be called in the context on a
	new thread.  This must be done by the C library.  The kernel must deliver a
	notice of the event to the C library when the callback should be called.
	
	This patch switches to a new, simpler interface: User space creates a socket
	with socket(PF_NETLINK, SOCK_RAW,0) and passes the fd to the mq_notify call
	together with a cookie.  When the mq_notify() condition is satisfied, the
	kernel "writes" the cookie to the socket.  User space then reads the cookie
	and calls the appropriate callback.

	[PATCH] compat emulation for posix message queues
	
	From: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
	
	I have tested the code with the open posix test suite and found the same
	four failures for both 64-bit and compat mode, most tests pass.  The patch
	is against -mc1, but I guess it also applies to the other trees around.
	
	What worries me more than mq_attr compatibility is the conversion of struct
	sigevent, which might turn out really hard when more fields in there are
	used.  AFAICS, the only other part in the kernel ABI is sys_timer_create(),
	so maybe it's not too late to deprecate the current structure and create a
	structure that can be used properly for compat syscalls.

	[PATCH] IPMI driver updates
	
	From: Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>
	
	- Add support for messaging through an IPMI LAN interface, which is

	  drivers.  It also does some renaming and a lot of little cleanups.
	
	- Add the "System Interface" driver.  The previous driver for system
	  interfaces only supported the KCS interface, this driver supports all
	  system interfaces defined in the IPMI standard.  It also does a much better
	  job of handling ACPI and SMBIOS tables for detecting IPMI system

	the old incremental min calculations was that the min value became very

	[PATCH] ext3 fsync() and fdatasync() speedup
	
	ext3's fsync/fdatasync implementation is currently syncing the inode via a
	full journal commit even if it was unaltered.
	
	Fix that up by exporting the core VFS's inode sync function to modules and
	calling it if the inode is dirty.  We need to do it this way so that the
	inode is moved to the appropriate superblock list and so that the i_state
	dirty flags are appropriately updated.
	
	This speeds up ext3 fsync() for file overwrites by a factor of four (disk
	non-writeback) to forty (disk in writeback mode).

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] speed up ext2 fsync() and fdatasync()
	
	ext2_sync_file() forgets to clear the inode's dirty bits, so we write the
	inode on every fsync(), even if it hasn't changed.
	
	Fix that up via the new sync_file() API which correctly manages the inode
	state bits and the superblock inode lists.
	
	When performing file overwrite on IDE with and without writeback caching
	enabled this patch approximately doubles fsync() speed, bringing it into line
	with O_SYNC writes.
	
	Also, fix up the return value handling in ext2_sync_file().
	
	Credit due to Jeffrey Siegal <jbs@quiotix.com> who noticed the performance
	discrepancy and wrote a test app.

	[PATCH] jbd: fix ordered-data writeout logic
	
	There's some nasty code in commit which deals with a lock ranking problem. 
	Currently if it fails to get the lock when and local variable `bufs' is zero
	we forget to write out some ordered-data buffers.  So a subsequent
	crash+recovery could yield stale data in existing files.
	
	Fix it by correctly restarting the t_sync_datalist search.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] JBD: ordered-data commit cleanup
	
	For data=ordered, kjournald at commit time has to write out and wait upon a
	long list of buffers.  It does this in a rather awkward way with a single
	list.  it causes complexity and long lock hold times, and makes the addition
	of rescheduling points quite hard
	
	So what we do instead (based on Chris Mason's suggestion) is to add a new
	buffer list (t_locked_list) to the journal.  It contains buffers which have
	been placed under I/O.
	
	So as we walk the t_sync_datalist list we move buffers over to t_locked_list
	as they are written out.
	
	When t_sync_datalist is empty we may then walk t_locked_list waiting for the
	I/O to complete.
	
	As a side-effect this means that we can remove the nasty synchronous wait in
	journal_dirty_data which is there to avoid the kjournald livelock which would
	otherwise occur when someone is continuously dirtying a buffer.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] jbd: fix I/O error handling
	
	Fix a few buglets spotted by Jeff Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com>.  We're currently

	they were first inspected.
	
	We need to check buffer_uptodate() even if the buffers were already unlocked.

	[PATCH] slab: updates for per-arch alignments
	
	From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
	
	Description:
	
	Right now kmem_cache_create automatically decides about the alignment of
	allocated objects. The automatic decisions are sometimes wrong:
	
	- for some objects, it's better to keep them as small as possible to
	  reduce the memory usage.  Ingo already added a parameter to
	  kmem_cache_create for the sigqueue cache, but it wasn't implemented.
	
	- for s390, normal kmalloc must be 8-byte aligned.  With debugging
	  enabled, the default allocation was 4-bytes.  This means that s390 cannot
	  enable slab debugging.
	
	- arm26 needs 1 kB aligned objects.  Previously this was impossible to
	  generate, therefore arm has its own allocator in
	  arm26/machine/small_page.c
	
	- most objects should be cache line aligned, to avoid false sharing.  But
	  the cache line size was set at compile time, often to 128 bytes for
	  generic kernels.  This wastes memory.  The new code uses the runtime
	  determined cache line size instead.
	
	- some caches want an explicit alignment.  One example are the pte_chain
	  objects: they must find the start of the object with addr&mask.  Right
	  now pte_chain objects are scaled to the cache line size, because that was
	  the only alignment that could be generated reliably.
	
	The implementation reuses the "offset" parameter of kmem_cache_create and
	now uses it to pass in the requested alignment.  offset was ignored by the
	current implementation, and the only user I found is sigqueue, which
	intended to set the alignment.
	
	In the long run, it might be interesting for the main tree: due to the 128
	byte alignment, only 7 inodes fit into one page, with 64-byte alignment, 9
	inodes - 20% memory recovered for Athlon systems.
	
	
	
	For generic kernels  running on P6 cpus (i.e. 32 byte cachelines), it means
	
	Number of objects per page:
	
	 ext2_inode_cache: 8 instead of 7
	 ext3_inode_cache: 8 instead of 7
	 fat_inode_cache: 9 instead of 7
	 rpc_tasks: 24 instead of 15
	 tcp_tw_bucket: 40 instead of 30
	 arp_cache: 40 instead of 30
	 nfs_write_data: 9 instead of 7

	[PATCH] sb_mixer bounds checking
	
	From: Muli Ben-Yehuda <mulix@mulix.org>
	
	This patch add proper bounds checking to the sb_mixer.c code, found by the
	stanford checker[0].  It fixes bugzilla bugs 252[1], 253[2] and 254[3]. 
	Patch is against 2.6.5-rc2.  It was tested by Rene Herman on SN AWE64 gold
	and sound still works.  The issue was previously discussed on lkml[4], but
	apparently no fix was applied.
	
	The patch is a bit more intrusive than I would've liked, but I don't think
	it can be helped without really intrusive changes.  sb_devc has a pointer
	to an array (iomap) that is set at run time to point to arrays of variable
	sizes.  The patch adds an 'iomap_sz' member to sb_devc that is set to the
	length of the array, and does bounds checking in sb_common_mixer_set() and
	smw_mixer_set() agains that.

	[PATCH] add file_operations.fcntl
	
	From: Chuck Lever <cel@citi.umich.edu>
	
	O_DIRECT|O_APPEND cannot possibly work on NFS, so NFS needs some way of
	preventing the user from setting this combination.  We felt that the best
	way of implementing this restriction is to allow the filesytem to implement
	its own fcntl() handler.
	
	This patch does, that, and provide the appropriate handler for NFS.
	
	Additional details from Chuck:
	
	Forgetting O_DIRECT for a moment, O_APPEND writes on NFS don't work in any
	case when multiple clients are writing to a file, since an NFS client can
	never guarantee it knows where the true end of file is 100% of the time.
	it works as expected iff only one client writes to an O_APPEND file at a
	time.
	
	Multi-client O_APPEND writing doesn't seem to be a problem for any
	application I'm aware of.  Since it can be made to behave in the
	multi-client case with careful application logic or by using file locking,
	I don't think we should disallow it.
	
	I want to drop the inode semaphore when doing NFS direct I/O because it is
	synchronous; holding the i_sem means we reduce direct I/O concurrency to
	one I/O per file at a time.  the important thing sct was worried about was
	the case where a single client is writing with O_APPEND and O_DIRECT, and
	we don't hold the i_sem during the write.
	
	We must at least hold the i_sem when determining where the end of file is
	to do the O_APPEND write.  In 2.6, I believe that is handled correctly in
	the VFS layer, so this is not an issue for 2.6, right?

	[PATCH] Fix sys_time() to get subtick correction from the new xtime
	
	From: "La Monte H.P. Yarroll" <piggy@timesys.com>
	
	This is a Scott Wood patch against 2.6.3.
	
	
	Use gettimeofday() rather than xtime.tv_sec in sys_time(), since
	sys_stime() uses settimeofday() and thus subtracts the subtick correction
	from the new xtime.
	
	stime() used settimeofday(), but time() did not use gettimeofday().  Since
	settimeofday() subtracts out the current intra-tick correction, and nsec
	was 0 (since stime() only allows seconds), this resulted in xtime being
	slightly earlier than the time that was set.
	
	If time() had used gettimeofday(), the correction would have been applied,
	and everything would be fine.  However, instead time just reads the current
	xtime.tv_sec, so if time() is called immediately after stime(), you'll
	usually get a value one second earlier.

	[PATCH] Use valid node number when unmapping x86 CPUs
	
	From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
	
	From:  colpatch@us.ibm.com
	
	The cpu_2_node[] array for i386 is initialized to all 0's, meaning that
	until modified at CPU bring-up, all CPUs are mapped to node 0.
	
	When CPUs are brought online, they are mapped to the appropriate node by
	various mechanisms, depending on the underlying hardware.
	
	When we unmap CPUs (hotplug time), we should return the mapping for the CPU
	that is going away to its original state, ie: 0.
	
	When this code was initially submitted, the misguided poster (me) made the
	mistake of putting a -1 in the cpu_2_node[] array for the CPU going away.
	
	This patch fixes this mistake, and allows code to get a valid node number
	for all valid CPU numbers.  This is important, because most (if not all)
	callers do not error check the value returned by the cpu_to_node() macro,
	and they should not have to.  The API specifies that a valid node number be
	returned for any valid CPU number.

	From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
	
	Brian Gerst's patch which moved __this_module out from module.h into the

	undefined symbols for modules without a module_init (or module_exit), and
	hence didn't generate a version for them, causing the kernel to be tainted.
	
	The simple solution is to always include the versions for these functions. 
	Also includes two cleanups:
	
	1) alloc_symbol is easier to use if it populates ->next for us.
	
	2) add_exported_symbol should set owner to module, not head of module
	   list (we don't use this field in entries in that list, fortunately).

	s/bitmap_shift_write/bitmap_shift_right/ in one of the kerneldoc comments.
	
	The primary effect of the patch is to remove the MAX_BITMAP_BITS
	limitation, so restoring the NR_CPUS to be limited only by stackspace and
	slab allocator maximums.  They also look vaguely more efficient than the
	current code, though as this was not done for performance reasons, no
	performance testing was done.

	[PATCH] Fix huge sparse tmpfs files
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	Kevin P.  Fleming pointed out that the 2.6 tmpfs does not allow writing huge
	sparse files.  This is an unintended side-effect of the strict memory commit
	changes: which should make no difference.
	
	The solution is to treat the tmpfs files (of variable size) and the shmem
	objects (of fixed size) differently: sounds nasty but works out well.  The
	shmem objects follow the VM preallocation convention as before, but the tmpfs
	files revert to allocation on demand as a filesystem would.  If there's not
	enough memory to write to a tmpfs hole, it is reported as -ENOSPC rather than
	-ENOMEM, so the mmap writer gets SIGBUS rather than everyone else getting
	OOM-killed.

	[PATCH] ia64 MSI support
	
	From: "Nguyen, Tom L" <tom.l.nguyen@intel.com>
	
	Adds MSI support for ia64.
	
	- Modified existing code in drivers/pci/msi.c and drivers/pci/msi.h to
	  include MSI support on IA64 platform.
	
	- Based on the comments received from Zwane Mwaikambo and David Mosberger,
	  this patch consolidates the vector allocators as
	  assign_irq_vector(AUTO_ASSIGN) has the same semantics as
	  ia64_alloc_vector() by converting the existing uses of ia64_alloc_vector()
	  to assign_irq_vector(AUTO_ASSIGN).
	
	- Based on the comments received from Zwane Mwaikambo, this patch
	  consolidates the semantics of vector allocator assign_irq_vector() in
	  drivers/pci/msi.c into the relevant architecture's vector allocator
	  assign_irq_vector() in arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c.
	
	- Regarding vector allocation, this patch modifies the existing function
	  assign_irq_vector() to maximize the number of allocated vectors to 188
	  before going -ENOSPC.
	
	- Based on your comments, this patch creates <asm-i386/msi.h>,
	  <asm-ia64/msi.h> and <asm-x86_64/msi.h>, includes <asm/msi.h> from within
	  drivers/pci/msi.h and then places all the code which is currently under
	  ifdef in msi.h into the relevant architecture's <asm/msi.h> file.
	
	- Based on your comments, this patch places pci_vector_resources() in
	  existing drivers/pci/msi.c in the relevant architecture implementations
	  such as into arch/.../pci/irq.c.

	[PATCH] O_DIRECT data exposure fixes
	
	From: Badari Pulavarty, Suparna Bhattacharya, Andrew Morton
	
	Forward port of Stephen Tweedie's DIO fixes from 2.4, to fix various DIO vs
	buffered IO exposures involving races causing:
	
	(a) stale data from uninstantiated blocks to be read, e.g.
	
	    - O_DIRECT reads against buffered writes to a sparse region
	
	    - O_DIRECT writes to a sparse region against buffered reads
	
	(b) potential data corruption with
	
	    - O_DIRECT IOs against truncate
	
	    due to writes to truncated blocks (which may have been reallocated to
	    another file).
	
	Summary of fixes:
	
	1) All the changes affect only regular files.  RAW/O_DIRECT on block are
	   unaffected. 
	
	2) The DIO code will not fill in sparse regions on a write.  Instead
	   -ENOTBLK is returned and the generic file write code would fallthrough to
	   buffered IO in this case followed by writing through the pages to disk
	   using filemap_fdatawrite/wait.
	
	3) i_sem is held during both DIO reads and writes.  For reads, and writes
	   to already allocated blocks, it is released right after IO is issued,
	   while for writes to newly allocated blocks (e.g file extending writes and
	   hole overwrites) it is held all the way through until IO completes (and
	   data is committed to disk).
	
	4) filemap_fdatawrite/wait are called under i_sem to synchronize buffered
	   pages to disk blocks before issuing DIO.
	
	5) A new rwsem (i_alloc_sem) is held in shared mode all the while a DIO
	   (read or write) is in progress, and in exclusive mode by truncate to guard
	   against deallocation of data blocks during DIO. 
	
	6) All this new locking has been pushed down into blockdev_direct_IO to
	   avoid interfering with NFS direct IO.  The locks are taken in the order
	   i_sem followed by i_alloc_sem.  While i_sem may be released after IO
	   submission in some cases, i_alloc_sem is held through until dio_complete
	   (in the case of AIO-DIO this happens through the IO completion callback).
	
	7) i_sem and i_alloc_sem are not held for the _nolock versions of write
	   routines, as used by blockdev and XFS.  Filesystems can specify the
	   needs_special_locking parameter to __blockdev_direct_IO from their direct
	   IO address space op accordingly.
	
	Note from Badari:
	Here is the locking (when needs_special_locking is true):
	
	(1) generic_file_*_write() holds i_sem (as before) and calls
	    ->direct_IO().  blockdev_direct_IO gets i_alloc_sem and call
	    direct_io_worker().
	
	(2) generic_file_*_read() does not hold any locks.  blockdev_direct_IO()
	    gets i_sem and then i_alloc_sem and calls direct_io_worker() to do the
	    work
	
	(3) direct_io_worker() does the work and drops i_sem after submitting IOs
	    if appropriate and drops i_alloc_sem after completing IOs.

	[PATCH] Fix race between ll_rw_block() and block_write_full_page()
	
	Fix a race which was identified by Daniel McNeil <daniel@osdl.org>
	
	If a buffer_head is under I/O due to JBD's ordered data writeout (which uses
	ll_rw_block()) then either filemap_fdatawrite() or filemap_fdatawait() need
	to wait on the buffer's existing I/O.
	
	Presently neither will do so, because __block_write_full_page() will not
	actually submit any I/O and will hence not mark the page as being under
	writeback.
	
	The best-performing fix would be to somehow mark the page as being under
	writeback and defer waiting for the ll_rw_block-initiated I/O until
	filemap_fdatawait()-time.  But this is hard, because in
	__block_write_full_page() we do not have control of the buffer_head's end_io
	handler.  Possibly we could make JBD call into end_buffer_async_write(), but
	that gets nasty.
	
	This patch makes __block_write_full_page() wait for any buffer_head I/O to
	complete before inspecting the buffer_head state.  It only does this in the
	case where __block_write_full_page() was called for a "data-integrity" write:
	(wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_NONE).
	
	Probably it doesn't matter, because kjournald is currently submitting (or has
	already submitted) all dirty buffers anyway.

	[PATCH] blockdev direct-io speedups
	
	From: Badari Pulavarty <pbadari@us.ibm.com>
	
	1) blkdev_direct_IO() calls blockdev_direct_IO() instead of

	[PATCH] direct-io AIO fixes
	
	From: Suparna Bhattacharya <suparna@in.ibm.com>
	
	Fixes the following remaining issues with the DIO code:
	
	1. During DIO file extends, intermediate writes could extend i_size
	   exposing unwritten blocks to intermediate reads (Soln: Don't drop i_sem
	   for file extends)
	
	2. AIO-DIO file extends may update i_size before I/O completes,
	   exposing unwritten blocks to intermediate reads.  (Soln: Force AIO-DIO
	   file extends to be synchronous)
	
	3. AIO-DIO writes to holes call aio_complete() before falling back to
	   buffered I/O !  (Soln: Avoid calling aio_complete() if -ENOTBLK)
	
	4. AIO-DIO writes to an allocated region followed by a hole, falls back
	   to buffered i/o without waiting for already submitted i/o to complete;
	   might return to user-space, which could overwrite the buffer contents
	   while they are still being written out by the kernel (Soln: Always wait
	   for submitted i/o to complete before falling back to buffered i/o)

	[PATCH] AIO+DIO bio_count race fix
	
	From: Suparna Bhattacharya <suparna@in.ibm.com>,
	      Daniel McNeil <daniel@osdl.org>
	
	This patch ensures that when the DIO code falls back to buffered i/o after
	having submitted part of the i/o, then buffered i/o is issued only for the
	remaining part of the request (i.e.  the part not already covered by DIO),
	rather than redo the entire i/o.  Now, instead of returning written ==
	-ENOTBLK, generic_file_direct_IO returns the number of bytes already handled
	by DIO, so that the caller knows how much of the I/O is left to be handled
	via fallback to buffered write.
	
	We need to careful not to access dio fields if its possible that the dio
	could already have been freed asynchronously during i/o completion.  A tricky
	part of this involves plugging the window between the decrement of bio_count
	and accessing dio->waiter during i/o completion where the dio could get freed
	by the submission path.  This potential "bio_count race" was tackled (by
	Daniel) by changing bio_list_lock into bio_lock and using that for all the
	bio fields.  Now bio_count and bios_in_flight have been converted from
	atomics into int and are both protected by the bio_lock.  The race in
	finished_one_bio() could thus be fixed by leaving the bio_count at 1 until
	after the dio_complete() and then doing the bio_count decrement and wakeup
	holding the bio_lock.  It appears that shifting to the spin_lock instead of
	atomic_inc/decs is ok performance wise as well.
	
	Update:
	
	An AIO O_DIRECT request was extending the file so it was done
	synchronously.  However, the request got an EFAULT and direct_io_worker()
	was calling aio_complete() on the iocb and returning the EFAULT.  When
	io_submit_one() got the EFAULT return, it assume it had to call
	aio_complete() since the i/o never got queued.
	
	The fix is for direct_io_worker() to only call aio_complete() when the
	upper layer is going to return -EIOCBQUEUED and not when getting errors
	that are being return to the submit path.

	[PATCH] rw_swap_page_sync(): place the pages in swapcache

	[PATCH] radix-tree tags for selective lookup
	
	Add radix-tree tagging so we can look up dirty or writeback pages in
	O(log64(n)) time.
	
	Each radix-tree node gains two bits for each slot: one for page dirtiness and
	one for page writebackness.
	
	If a tag bit is set on a leaf node, it indicates that item at the
	corresponding slot is tagged (say, a dirty page).
	
	If a tag bit is set in a non-leaf node it indicates that the same tag bit is
	set in the subtree which lies under the corresponding slot.  ie: "there is a
	dirty page under here somewhere, but you need to search down further to find
	it".
	
	A gang lookup function is provided which can walk the radix tree in
	logarithmic time looking for items which are tagged, starting from a
	specified offset.  We use this for in-order searches for dirty or writeback
	pages.
	
	There is a userspace test harness for this code at
	
	http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/rtth.tar.gz

	[PATCH] make the pagecache lock irq-safe.
	
	Intro to these patches:
	
	- Major surgery against the pagecache, radix-tree and writeback code.  This
	  work is to address the O_DIRECT-vs-buffered data exposure horrors which
	  we've been struggling with for months.
	
	  As a side-effect, 32 bytes are saved from struct inode and eight bytes
	  are removed from struct page.  At a cost of approximately 2.5 bits per page
	  in the radix tree nodes on 4k pagesize, assuming the pagecache is densely
	  populated.  Not all pages are pagecache; other pages gain the full 8 byte
	  saving.
	
	  This change will break any arch code which is using page->list and will
	  also break any arch code which is using page->lru of memory which was
	  obtained from slab.
	
	  The basic problem which we (mainly Daniel McNeil) have been struggling
	  with is in getting a really reliable fsync() across the page lists while
	  other processes are performing writeback against the same file.  It's like
	  juggling four bars of wet soap with your eyes shut while someone is
	  whacking you with a baseball bat.  Daniel pretty much has the problem
	  plugged but I suspect that's just because we don't have testcases to
	  trigger the remaining problems.  The complexity and additional locking
	  which those patches add is worrisome.
	
	  So the approach taken here is to remove the page lists altogether and
	  replace the list-based writeback and wait operations with in-order
	  radix-tree walks.
	
	  The radix-tree code has been enhanced to support "tagging" of pages, for
	  later searches for pages which have a particular tag set.  This means that
	  we can ask the radix tree code "find me the next 16 dirty pages starting at
	  pagecache index N" and it will do that in O(log64(N)) time.
	
	  This affects I/O scheduling potentially quite significantly.  It is no
	  longer the case that the kernel will submit pages for I/O in the order in
	  which the application dirtied them.  We instead submit them in file-offset
	  order all the time.
	
	  This is likely to be advantageous when applications are seeking all over
	  a large file randomly writing small amounts of data.  I haven't performed
	  much benchmarking, but tiobench random write throughput seems to be
	  increased by 30%.  Other tests appear to be unaltered.  dbench may have got
	  10-20% quicker, but it's variable.
	
	  There is one large file which everyone seeks all over randomly writing
	  small amounts of data: the blockdev mapping which caches filesystem
	  metadata.  The kernel's IO submission patterns for this are now ideal.
	
	
	  Because writeback and wait-for-writeback use a tree walk instead of a
	  list walk they are no longer livelockable.  This probably means that we no
	  longer need to hold i_sem across O_SYNC writes and perhaps fsync() and
	  fdatasync().  This may be beneficial for databases: multiple processes
	  writing and syncing different parts of the same file at the same time can
	  now all submit and wait upon writes to just their own little bit of the
	  file, so we can get a lot more data into the queues.
	
	  It is trivial to implement a part-file-fdatasync() as well, so
	  applications can say "sync the file from byte N to byte M", and multiple
	  applications can do this concurrently.  This is easy for ext2 filesystems,
	  but probably needs lots of work for data-journalled filesystems and XFS and
	  it probably doesn't offer much benefit over an i_semless O_SYNC write.
	
	
	  These patches can end up making ext3 (even) slower:
	
		for i in 1 2 3 4
		do
			dd if=/dev/zero of=$i bs=1M count=2000 &
		done          
	
	  runs awfully slow on SMP.  This is, yet again, because all the file
	  blocks are jumbled up and the per-file linear writeout causes tons of
	  seeking.  The above test runs sweetly on UP because the on UP we don't
	  allocate blocks to different files in parallel.
	
	  Mingming and Badari are working on getting block reservation working for
	  ext3 (preallocation on steroids).  That should fix ext3 up.
	
	
	This patch:
	
	- Later, we'll need to access the radix trees from inside disk I/O
	  completion handlers.  So make mapping->page_lock irq-safe.  And rename it
	  to tree_lock to reliably break any missed conversions.

	[PATCH] revert the slabification of i386 pgd's and pmd's
	
	This code is playing with page->lru from pages which came from slab.  But to

	cannot allow the i386 pagetable code to go scribbling on the ->lru field of

	[PATCH] fdatasync integrity fix
	
	fdatasync can fail to wait on some pages due to a race.
	
	If some task (eg pdflush) is flushing the same mapping it can remove a page's
	dirty tag but not then mark that page as being under writeback, because
	pdflush hit a locked buffer in __block_write_full_page().  This will happen
	because kjournald is writing the buffer.  In this situation
	__block_write_full_page() will redirty the page so that fsync notices it, but
	there is a window where the page eludes the radix tree dirty page walk.
	
	Consequently a concurrent fsync will fail to notice the page when walking the
	radix tree's dirty pages.
	
	The approach taken by this patch is to leave the page marked as dirty in the
	radix tree while ->writepage is working out what to do with it.  This ensures
	that a concurrent write-for-sync will successfully locate the page and will
	then block in lock_page() until the non-write-for-sync code has finished
	altering the page state.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] don't allow background writes to hide dirty buffers
	
	If pdflush hits a locked-and-clean buffer in __block_write_full_page() it
	will just pass over the buffer.  Typically the buffer is an ext3 data=ordered
	buffer which is being written by kjournald, but a similar thing can happen
	with blockdev buffers and ll_rw_block().
	
	This is bad because the buffer is still under I/O and a subsequent fsync's
	fdatawait() needs to know about it.
	
	It is not practical to tag the page for writeback - only the submitter of the
	I/O can do that, because the submitter has control of the end_io handler.
	
	So instead, redirty the page so a subsequent fsync's fdatawrite() will wait on
	the underway I/O.
	
	There is a risk that pdflush::background_writeout() will lock up, repeatedly
	trying and failing to write the same page.  This is prevented by ensuring
	that background_writeout() always throttles when it made no progress.

	[PATCH] writeback efficiency and QoS improvements
	
	The radix-tree walk for writeback has a couple of problems:
	
	a) It always scans a file from its first dirty page, so if someone
	   is repeatedly dirtying the front part of a file, pages near the end
	   may be starved of writeout.  (Well, not completely: the `kupdate'
	   function will write an entire file once the file's dirty timestamp
	   has expired).  
	
	b) When the disk queues are huge (10000 requests), there can be a
	   very large number of locked pages.  Scanning past these in writeback
	   consumes quite some CPU time.
	
	So in each address_space we record the index at which the last batch of
	writeout terminated and start the next batch of writeback from that
	point.

	[PATCH] Add mpage_writepages() scheduling point
	
	From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
	
	Takashi did some nice latency testing of the current kernel (with -mm
	writeback changes), and the biggest offender in general core is
	mpage_writepages().

	[PATCH] mpage_writepages() cleanup
	
	Rework the code layout a bit.  No logic change.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] use compound pages for hugetlb pages only
	
	The compound page logic is a little fragile - it relies on additional
	metadata in the pageframes which some other kernel code likes to stomp on
	(xfs was doing this).
	
	Also, because we're treating all higher-order pages as compound pages it is
	no longer possible to free individual lower-order pages from the middle of
	higher-order pages.  At least one ARM driver insists on doing this.
	
	We only really need the compound page logic for higher-order pages which can
	be mapped into user pagetables and placed under direct-io.  This covers
	hugetlb pages and, conceivably, soundcard DMA buffers which were allcoated
	with a higher-order allocation but which weren't marked PageReserved.
	
	The patch arranges for the hugetlb implications to allocate their pages with
	compound page metadata, and all other higher-order allocations go back to the
	old way.

	[PATCH] fork vma ordering during fork
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	First of six patches against 2.6.5-rc3, cleaning up mremap's move_vma, and
	fixing truncation orphan issues raised by Rajesh Venkatasubramanian. 
	Originally done as part of the anonymous objrmap work on mremap move, but
	useful fixes now extracted for mainline.  The mremap changes need some
	exposure in the -mm tree first, but the first (fork one-liner) is safe enough
	to go straight into 2.6.5.
	
	
	
	From: Rajesh Venkatasubramanian.  Despite the comment that child vma should
	be inserted just after parent vma, 2.5.6 did exactly the reverse: thus a
	racing vmtruncate may free the child's ptes, then advance to the parent, and
	meanwhile copy_page_range has propagated more ptes from the parent to the
	child, leaving file pages still mapped after truncation.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] mremap: copy_one_pte cleanup
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	Clean up mremap move's copy_one_pte:
	
	- get_one_pte_map_nested already weeded out the pte_none case,
	  now don't even call copy_one_pte if it has nothing to do.
	
	- check pfn_valid before passing page to page_remove_rmap.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] mremap: move_vma fixes and cleanup
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	Partial rewrite of mremap's move_vma.  Rajesh Venkatasubramanian has pointed
	out that vmtruncate could miss ptes, leaving orphaned pages, because move_vma
	only made the new vma visible after filling it.  We see no good reason for
	that, and time to make move_vma more robust.
	
	Removed all its vma merging decisions, leave them to mmap.c's vma_merge, with
	copy_vma added.  Removed duplicated is_mergeable_vma test from vma_merge, and
	duplicated validate_mm from insert_vm_struct.
	
	move_vma move from old to new then unmap old; but on error move back from new
	to old and unmap new.  Don't unwind within move_page_tables, let move_vma
	call it explicitly to unwind, with the right source vma.  Get the
	VM_ACCOUNTing right even when the final do_munmap fails.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] mremap: vma_relink_file race fix
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	Subtle point from Rajesh Venkatasubramanian: when mremap's move_vma fails and
	so rewinds, before moving the file-based ptes back, we must move new_vma
	before old vma in the i_mmap or i_mmap_shared list, so that when racing
	against vmtruncate we cannot propagate pages to be truncated back from
	new_vma into the just cleaned old_vma.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] mremap: check map_count
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	mremap's move_vma should think ahead to lessen the chance of failure during
	its rewind on failure: running out of memory always possible, but it's silly
	for it to embark when it's near the map_count limit.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] Fix rmap comment
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	rmap's try_to_unmap_one comments on find_vma failure, that a page may
	temporarily be absent from a vma during mremap: no longer, though it is still
	possible for this find_vma to fail, while unmap_vmas drops page_table_lock
	(but that is no problem for file truncation).

	[PATCH] laptop mode
	
	From: Bart Samwel <bart@samwel.tk>
	
	Adds /proc/sys/vm/laptop-mode: a special knob which says "this is a laptop".
	In this mode the kernel will attempt to avoid spinning disks up.
	
	Algorithm: the idea is to hold dirty data in memory for a long time, but to
	flush everything which has been accumulated if the disk happens to spin up
	for other reasons.
	
	- Whenever a disk request completes (read or write), schedule a timer a few
	  seconds hence.  If the timer was already pending, reset it to a few seconds
	  hence.
	
	- When the timer expires, write back the whole world.  We use
	  sync_filesystems() for this because it will force ext3 journal commits as
	  well.
	
	- In balance_dirty_pages(), kick off background writeback when we hit the
	  high threshold (dirty_ratio), not when we hit the low threshold.  This has
	  the effect of causing "lumpy" writeback which is something I spent a year
	  fixing, but in laptop mode, it is desirable.
	
	- In try_to_free_pages(), only kick pdflush if the VM is getting into
	  distress: we want to keep scanning for clean pages, deferring writeback.
	
	- In page reclaim, avoid writing back the odd random dirty page off the
	  LRU: only start I/O if the scanning is working harder.
	
	The effect is to perform a sync() a few seconds after all I/O has ceased.
	
	The value which was written into /proc/sys/vm/laptop-mode determines, in
	seconds, the delay between the final I/O and the flush.
	
	Additionally, the patch adds tools which help answer the question "why the
	heck does my disk spin up all the time?".  The user may set
	/proc/sys/vm/block_dump to a non-zero value and the kernel will print out
	information which will identify the process which is performing disk reads or
	which is dirtying pagecache.
	
	The user should probably disable syslogd before setting block-dump.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] Add commit=0 to ext3, meaning "set commit to default".
	
	From: Bart Samwel <bart@samwel.tk>
	
	Add support for the value "0" to ext3's "commit" option.  When this value
	is given, ext3 substitutes it by the default commit interval.  Introduce a
	constant JBD_DEFAULT_MAX_COMMIT_AGE for this.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] Honour the readahead tunable in filemap_nopage()
	
	Remove the hardwired pagefault readaround distance in filemap_nopage() and
	use the per-file readahead setting.
	
	The main reason for this is in fact laptop-mode.  If you want to prevent the
	disk from spinning up then you want all of your application's pages to be
	pulled into memory in one hit.  Otherwise the disk will spin up each time you
	use a new part of whatever application(s) you are running.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] Fix logic in filemap_nopage()
	
	The filempa_nopage() logic will go into a tight loop if
	do_page_cache_readahead() doesn't actually start I/O against the target page.
	This can happen if the disk is read-congested, or if the filesystem doesn't
	want to read that part of the file for some reason.
	
	We will accidentally break out of the loop because
	
		 (ra->mmap_miss > ra->mmap_hit + MMAP_LOTSAMISS)
	
	will eventually become true.
	
	Fix that up.

	[PATCH] ia32: 4Kb stacks (and irqstacks) patch
	
	From: Arjan van de Ven <arjanv@redhat.com>
	
	Below is a patch to enable 4Kb stacks for x86. The goal of this is to
	
	1) Reduce footprint per thread so that systems can run many more threads
	   (for the java people)
	
	2) Reduce the pressure on the VM for order > 0 allocations. We see real life
	   workloads (granted with 2.4 but the fundamental fragmentation issue isn't
	   solved in 2.6 and isn't solvable in theory) where this can be a problem.
	   In addition order > 0 allocations can make the VM "stutter" and give more
	   latency due to having to do much much more work trying to defragment
	
	The first 2 bits of the patch actually affect compiler options in a generic
	way: I propose to disable the -funit-at-a-time feature from gcc.  With this
	enabled (and it's default with -O2), gcc will very agressively inline
	functions, which is nice and all for userspace, but for the kernel this makes
	us suffer a gcc deficiency more: gcc is extremely bad at sharing stackslots,
	for example a situation like this:
	
	if (some_condition)
		function_A();
	else
		function_B();
	
	with -funit-at-a-time, both function_A() and _B() might get inlined, however
	the stack usage of both functions of the parent function grows the stack
	usage of both functions COMBINED instead of the maximum of the two.  Even
	with the normal 8Kb stacks this is a danger since we see some functions grow
	3Kb to 4Kb of stack use this way.  With 4Kb stacks, 4Kb of stack usage growth
	obviously is deadly ;-( but even with 8Kb stacks it's pure lottery.
	Disabling -funit-at-a-time also exposes another thing in the -mm tree; the
	attribute always_inline is considered harmful by gcc folks in that when gcc
	makes a decision to NOT inline a function marked this way, it throws an
	error.  Disabling -funit-at-a-time disables some of the agressive inlining
	(eg of large functions that come later in the .c file) so this would make
	your tree not compile.
	
	The 4k stackness of the kernel is included in modversions, so people don't
	load 4k-stack modules into 8k-stack kernels.
	
	At present 4k stacks are selectable in config.  When the feature has settled
	in we should remove the 8k option.  This will break the nvidia modules.  But
	Fedora uses 4k stacks so a new nvidia driver is expected soon.

	[PATCH] ppc64: NUMA fix for 16MB LMBs
	
	From: Olof Johansson <olof@austin.ibm.com>
	
	As discussed on the ppc64 list yesterday and today:
	
	On some ppc64 systems, Open Firmware will give memory device nodes that are
	only 16MB in size, instead of the 256MB that our NUMA code currently
	expects (see MEMORY_INCREMENT in mmzone.h).
	
	Just changing the defines from 256MB to 16MB makes the table blow up from
	32KB to 512KB, so this patch also makes it dynamically allocated based on
	actual memory size.  Since all this is done before (well, during) bootmem
	init so we need to use lmb_alloc().
	
	Finally, there's no need to use a full int for node ID. Current max is 16
	nodes, so a signed char still leaves plenty of room to grow.

	[PATCH] selinux: add IPv6 support
	
	From: James Morris <jmorris@redhat.com>
	
	The patch below adds explicit IPv6 support to SELinux.
	
	Brief description of changes:
	
	o IPv6 networking is now subject to the same controls as IPv4 (in
	  addition to the generic socket permissions which cover all protocols),
	  namely: bind to local node address; bind to local port; send & receive
	  TCP/UDP and raw IP packets based on local network interface and remote
	  node address.
	
	o Packet parsing has been extended to IPv6 packets for logging and
	  control, and simplified for IPv4.
	
	o Support for logging of IPv6 addresses has also been added.
	
	o The kernel policy database code has been modified to support IPv6, and
	  reworked to provide generic security policy version handling so that
	  older policy versions will still work, making upgrading simpler.
	
	Corresponding userspace patches are available at
	<http://people.redhat.com/jmorris/selinux/ipv6/>, although current
	userspace tools will continue to function normally (but without explicit
	IPv6 support).
	
	For more details at the security management level, see
	<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=selinux&m=108068187630948&w=2>
	
	This code has been under testing and review for several weeks.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] From: James Morris <jmorris@redhat.com>
	
	This patch removes a harmless duplicate assignment from the IPv6 code.

	[PATCH] Light-weight Auditing Framework
	
	From: Rik Faith <faith@redhat.com>
	
	This patch provides a low-overhead system-call auditing framework for Linux
	that is usable by LSM components (e.g., SELinux).  This is an update of the
	patch discussed in this thread:
	
	    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107815888100001&r=1&w=2
	
	In brief, it provides for netlink-based logging of audit records that have
	been generated in other parts of the kernel (e.g., SELinux) as well as the
	ability to audit system calls, either independently (using simple
	filtering) or as a compliment to the audit record that another part of the
	kernel generated.
	
	The main goals were to provide system call auditing with 1) as low overhead
	as possible, and 2) without duplicating functionality that is already
	provided by SELinux (and/or other security infrastructures).  This
	framework will work "stand-alone", but is not designed to provide, e.g.,
	CAPP functionality without another security component in place.
	
	This updated patch includes changes from feedback I have received,
	including the ability to compile without CONFIG_NET (and better use of
	tabs, so use -w if you diff against the older patch).
	
	Please see http://people.redhat.com/faith/audit/ for an early example
	user-space client (auditd-0.4.tar.gz) and instructions on how to try it.
	
	My future intentions at the kernel level include improving filtering (e.g.,
	syscall personality/exit codes) and syscall support for more architectures.
	 First, though, I'm going to work on documentation, a (real) audit daemon,
	and patches for other user-space tools so that people can play with the
	framework and understand how it can be used with and without SELinux.
	
	
	Update:
	
	Light-weight Auditing Framework receive filter fixes
	From: Rik Faith <faith@redhat.com>
	
	Since audit_receive_filter() is only called with audit_netlink_sem held, it
	cannot race with either audit_del_rule() or audit_add_rule(), so the
	list_for_each_entry_rcu()s may be replaced by list_for_each_entry()s, and
	the rcu_read_{un,}lock()s removed.  A fix for this is part of the attached
	patch.
	
	Other features of the attached patch are:
	
	1) generalized the ability to test for inequality
	
	2) added syscall exit status reporting and testing
	
	3) added ability to report and test first 4 syscall arguments (this adds
	   a large amount of flexibility for little cost; not implemented or tested
	   on ppc64)
	
	4) added ability to report and test personality
	
	User-space demo program enhanced for new fields and inequality testing:

	[PATCH] selinux: Audit compute_sid errors
	
	From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
	
	This patch changes an error message printk'd by security_compute_sid to use
	the audit framework instead.  These errors reflect situations where a
	security transition would normally occur due to policy, but the resulting
	security context is not valid.  The patch also changes the code to always
	call the audit framework rather than only doing so when permissive as this
	was causing problems with testing policy, and does some code cleanup.

	[PATCH] selinux: remove ratelimit from avc
	
	From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>

	be handled by the audit framework.  Enabling and setting the ratelimit is
	then left to userspace.

	[PATCH] binfmt_elf.c fix for 32-bit apps with large bss
	
	From: Julie DeWandel <jdewand@redhat.com>
	
	A problem exists where a 32-bit application can have a huge bss, one that
	is so large that an overflow of the TASK_SIZE happens.  But in this case,
	the overflow is not detected in load_elf_binary().  Instead, because
	arithmetic is being done using 32-bit containers, a truncation occurs and
	the program gets loaded when it shouldn't have been.  Subsequent execution
	yields unpredictable results.
	
	The attached patch fixes this problem by checking for the overflow
	condition and sending a SIGKILL to the application if the overflow is
	detected.  This problem can in theory exist when loading the elf
	interpreter as well, so a similar check was added there.

	[PATCH] fix posix-timers to have proper per-process scope
	
	From: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>
	
	The posix-timers implementation associates timers with the creating thread
	and destroys timers when their creator thread dies.  POSIX clearly
	specifies that these timers are per-process, and a timer should not be torn
	down when the thread that created it exits.  I hope there won't be any
	controversy on what the correct semantics are here, since POSIX is clear
	and the Linux feature is called "posix-timers".
	
	The attached program built with NPTL -lrt -lpthread demonstrates the bug.
	The program is correct by POSIX, but fails on Linux.  Note that a until
	just the other day, NPTL had a trivial bug that always disabled its use of
	kernel timer syscalls (check strace for lack of timer_create/SYS_259).  So
	unless you have built your own NPTL libs very recently, you probably won't
	see the kernel calls actually used by this program.
	
	Also attached is my patch to fix this.  It (you guessed it) moves the
	posix_timers field from task_struct to signal_struct.  Access is now
	governed by the siglock instead of the task lock.  exit_itimers is called
	from __exit_signal, i.e.  only on the death of the last thread in the
	group, rather than from do_exit for every thread.  Timers' it_process
	fields store the group leader's pointer, which won't die.  For the case of
	SIGEV_THREAD_ID, I hold a ref on the task_struct for it_process to stay
	robust in case the target thread dies; the ref is released and the dangling
	pointer cleared when the timer fires and the target thread is dead.  (This
	should only come up in a buggy user program, so noone cares exactly how the
	kernel handles that case.  But I think what I did is robust and sensical.)

	[PATCH] ia64: Allow IO port space without EFI RT attribute
	
	Some firmware does not require run-time mapping of the legacy IO port
	space.  (It may not need to perform any IO port operations, or it may
	do them with translation disabled.)
	
	(efi_get_iobase): Don't require that IO port space be marked RT, since
	there's no reason the firmware should require mappings for it.
	Thanks to Greg Albrecht for noticing this.
	
	Also, allow attributes in addition to EFI_MEMORY_UC.  I can't
	think of another current attribute that makes sense, but the
	kernel only depends on being able to use UC.

	[PATCH] Add queue congestion callout
	
	From: Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>
	
	The VM and VFS use the address_space_backing_dev_info to track the realtime
	status of the device which backs the mapping.  The read_congested and
	write_congested fields are used to determine whether a read or write
	against that device may block.
	
	We use this infrastructure to
	
	a) allow pdflush to service many queues in parallel (by not getting
	   stuck on any particular one) and
	
	b) to avoid undesirable and uncontrolled latencies in places such as
	   page reclaim and
	
	c) To avoid blocking in readahead operations
	
	The current code only supports simple disk queues (and I have a patch here
	for NFS).  Stacked queues (MD and DM) don't get this information right and
	problems were expected.  Efficiency problems have now been noted and it's
	time to fix it.
	
	This patch lays down the infrastructure which permits the queue
	implementation to get control when someone at a higher level is querying
	the queue's congestion state.  So DM (for example) can run around and
	examine all the queues which contribute to the higher-level queue.
	
	
	It also adds bdi_rw_congested() for code in xfs and ext2 that calls both
	bdi_read_congested() and bdi_write_congested() in a row, and it was "free"
	anyway.

	[PATCH] Implement queue congestion callout for device mapper
	
	From: Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>
	      Joe Thornber <thornber@redhat.com>
	
	This implements the queue congestion callout for DM stacks.  To make
	bdi_read/write_congested() return correct information.
	
	- md->lock protects all fields in md _except_ md->map
	- md->map_lock protects md->map
	- Anyone who wants to read md->map should use dm_get_table() which
	  increments the tables reference count.
	
	This means the spin lock is now only held for the duration of a
	reference count increment.
	
	Udpate:
	
	dm.c: protect md->map with a rw spin lock rather than the md->lock
	semaphore.  Also ensure that everyone accesses md->map through
	dm_get_table(), rather than directly.

	[PATCH] per-backing dev unplugging
	
	From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>,
	      Chris Mason,
	      me, others.
	
	The global unplug list causes horrid spinlock contention on many-disk
	many-CPU setups - throughput is worse than halved.
	
	The other problem with the global unplugging is of course that it will cause
	the unplugging of queues which are unrelated to the I/O upon which the caller
	is about to wait.
	
	So what we do to solve these problems is to remove the global unplug and set
	up the infrastructure under which the VFS can tell the block layer to unplug
	only those queues which are relevant to the page or buffer_head whcih is
	about to be waited upon.
	
	We do this via the very appropriate address_space->backing_dev_info structure.
	
	Most of the complexity is in devicemapper, MD and swapper_space, because for
	these backing devices, multiple queues may need to be unplugged to complete a
	page/buffer I/O.  In each case we ensure that data structures are in place to
	permit us to identify all the lower-level queues which contribute to the
	higher-level backing_dev_info.  Each contributing queue is told to unplug in
	response to a higher-level unplug.
	
	To simplify things in various places we also introduce the concept of a
	"synchronous BIO": it is tagged with BIO_RW_SYNC.  The block layer will
	perform an immediate unplug when it sees one of these go past.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] Use BIO_RW_SYNC in swap write page
	
	From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
	
	Dog slow software suspend found this one. If WB_SYNC_ALL, then you need
	to mark the bio as sync as well.
	
	This is because swap_writepage() does a remove_exclusive_swap_page() (going
	to __delete_from_swap_cache -> __remove_from_page_cache) which can kill
	page->mapping, thus aops->sync_page() has nothing to work with for unplugging
	the address space.

	[PATCH] unplugging: md update
	
	From: Neil Brown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>

	drives are actually in use.

	[PATCH] Correct unplugs on nr_queued
	
	From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
	
	There's a small discrepancy in when we decide to unplug a queue based on
	q->unplug_thresh.  Basically it doesn't work for tagged queues, since
	q->rq.count[READ] + q->rq.count[WRITE] is just the number of allocated
	requests, not the number of requests stuck in the io scheduler.  We could
	just change the nr_queued == to a nr_queued >=, however that is still
	suboptimal.
	
	This patch adds accounting for requests that have been dequeued from the io
	scheduler, but not freed yet.  These are q->in_flight.  allocated_requests
	- q->in_flight == requests_in_scheduler.  So the condition correctly
	becomes
	
		if (requests_in_scheduler == q->unplug_thresh)
	
	instead.  I did a quick round of testing, and for dbench on a SCSI disk the
	number of timer induced unplugs was reduced from 13 to 5 :-).  Not a huge
	number, but there might be cases where it's more significant.  Either way,
	it gets ->unplug_thresh always right, which the old logic didn't.

	[PATCH] rmap 1 linux/rmap.h
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	First of a batch of three rmap patches: this initial batch of three paving
	the way for a move to some form of object-based rmap (probably Andrea's, but
	drawing from mine too), and making almost no functional change by itself.  A
	few days will intervene before the next batch, to give the struct page
	changes in the second patch some exposure before proceeding.
	
	rmap 1 create include/linux/rmap.h
	
	Start small: linux/rmap-locking.h has already gathered some declarations
	unrelated to locking, and the rest of the rmap declarations were over in
	linux/swap.h: gather them all together in linux/rmap.h, and rename the
	pte_chain_lock to rmap_lock.

	[PATCH] rmap 2 anon and swapcache
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	Tracking anonymous pages by anon_vma,pgoff or mm,address needs a
	pointer,offset pair in struct page: mapping,index the natural choice.  But
	swapcache uses those for &swapper_space,swp_entry_t.
	
	It's trivial to separate swapcache from pagecache with radix tree; most of
	swapper_space is actually unused, just a fiction to pretend swap like file;
	and page->private is a good place to keep swp_entry_t, now that swap never
	uses bufferheads.
	
	Define PG_anon bit, page_add_rmap SetPageAnon and put an oopsable address in
	page->mapping to test that we're not confused by it.  Define
	page_mapping(page) macro to give NULL when PageAnon, whatever may be in
	page->mapping.  Define PG_swapcache bit, deduce swapper_space from that in
	the few places we need it.
	
	add_to_swap_cache now distinct from add_to_page_cache.  Separating the caches
	somewhat simplifies the tmpfs swizzling in swap_state.c, now the page can
	briefly be in both caches.
	
	The rmap method remains pte chains, no change to that yet.  But one small
	functional difference: the use of PageAnon implies that a page truncated
	while still mapped will no longer be found and freed (swapped out) by
	try_to_unmap, will only be freed by exit or munmap.  But normally pages are
	unmapped by vmtruncate: this should only affect nonlinear mappings, and a
	later patch not in this batch will fix that.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] rw_swap_page_sync fixes
	
	Fix up the rw_swap_page_sync() gorrors by fully decoupling this function
	from the VM - it is now just a helper function which reads a page from or
	writes a page to swap.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] rmap 3 arches + mapping_mapped
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	Some arches refer to page->mapping for their dcache flushing: use
	page_mapping(page) for safety, to avoid confusion on anon pages, which will
	store a different pointer there - though in most cases flush_dcache_page is
	being applied to pagecache pages.
	
	arm has a useful mapping_mapped macro: move that to generic, and add
	mapping_writably_mapped, to avoid explicit list_empty checks on i_mmap and
	i_mmap_shared in several places.
	
	Very tempted to add page_mapped(page) tests, perhaps along with the
	mapping_writably_mapped tests in do_generic_mapping_read and
	do_shmem_file_read, to cut down on wasted flush_dcache effort; but the
	serialization is not obvious, too unsafe to do in a hurry.

	[PATCH] cyclades works OK on SMP
	
	From: Marcelo Tosatti <marcelo.tosatti@cyclades.com>
	
	The cyclades.c driver was marked BROKEN_ON_SMP during early 2.6.  It was
	fixed later on but the tag was left in Kconfig.
	
	The driver is not very smart wrt SMP locking, it can be improved.  There is
	only one spinlock per card which guarantees command block ordering and
	protects different shared data, which can be held for long periods.
	
	_But_ the locking works reliably, so remove the BROKEN_ON_SMP tag.

	From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
	
	Directory notify code was showing up in a dd bs=1024k from 2 raid arrays

	61        1.1661  vmlinux-2.6.5            .do_generic_mapping_read
	
	We already have a sysctl to enable/disable it, the patch below uses it
	in dnotify_parent. dnotify_parent disappears and idle time goes up:
	
	4508     70.8582  vmlinux-2.6.5            .default_idle

	69        1.0846  vmlinux-2.6.5            .do_generic_mapping_read
	
	Of course, to gain this small speedup isers need to know to set
	/proc/sys/fs/dir-notify-enable to zero.  Nobody does that.

	So change things so that __journal_unfile_buffer() nulls out b_transaction
	inside both j_list_lock and jbd_lock_bh_state().
	
	It cleans things up a bit, too.

	[PATCH] i386 probe_roms(): preparation
	
	From: Rene Herman <rene.herman@keyaccess.nl>
	
	The i386 probe_roms() function has a fair number of problems currently:
	
	- When you actually have an adapter ROM in the machine, your video ROM
	  disappears.  This is due to the pc9800 subarch merge that split it up in
	  probe_video_rom(int roms) and probe_extension_roms(int roms), but expects a
	  "roms++" in probe_video_roms() to have an effect outside of that function.
	
	- The majority of VGA adapters these days host a ROM larger then 32K, yet
	  the current code hardcodes a 32K ROM.  The VGA BIOS "length" byte is
	  normally valid (it in fact needs to be for a regular mainboard BIOS to
	  accept it) and I've verified on a few dozen very new to very old VGAs that
	  it is.  However, assuming someone actually did not check for the length and
	  checksum there for a reason, the safe thing to do here is accept the length
	  byte when we also get a valid checksum.
	
	- The current code scans 0xc0000 to 0xdffff for a video ROM while the
	  standard PC thing to do (that which the BIOS does) is only scan for a video
	  ROM starting between 0xc0000 and 0xc7fff.  This means that on a headless-
	  (or BIOS-less monochrome adapter-) box, the first adapter ROM found
	  triggers the registration of a 32K "Video ROM" at hardcoded address
	  0xc0000, even when _nothing_ is present between 0xc0000 and 0xc7fff.
	
	- The current adapter ROM scan stops at 0xdffff, whether or not an
	  extension ROM is present at 0xe0000.  The PC thing to do is scan 0xc8000
	  upto 0xdffff if an extension ROM is present, and upto 0xeffff when it's not
	  (it's not/hardly ever).
	
	- Adapter ROMs are called "Extension ROM", but the latter term is really
	  better reserved for a motherboard extension ROM.
	
	- Currently, the code happily starts scanning through a ROM it just
	  registered looking for the next one (just does += 2048, even when that's
	  inside the previous ROM) which is at least silly.
	
	Unfortunately, this code is "subarched" between mach-default and
	mach-pc9800, meaning the patch got a bit involved. Currently all this
	code, and gobs of data, is defined (not just declared) in the header:
	
	   include/asm-i386/mach-{default,pc9800}/mach_resources.h
	
	which isn't nice. That .h really wants to be a .c. The first patch, in
	the next message, does not change any code but only undoes the
	probe_video_rom / probe_extension_roms split and moves the code to a new
	file
	
	   arch/i386/mach-{default,pc9800}/std_resources.c
	
	with a header
	
	   include/asm-i386/std_resources.h
	
	for the prototypes only. The second patch overhauls the code itself for
	mach-default. Please see comments on top of that patch for (yet more)
	comments. It's tested on various machines, with and without adapter ROMs.
	
	I haven't touched pc9800. Nothing should have changed though. The pc9800
	author, as given in the code, is CCed.
	
	Also, x86-64 inherits the probe_roms() code from 2.4, and while it
	doesn't have the subarch specific problems, it has all others. I'll
	convert it to if this i386 version is deemed desirable.
	
	
	
	This patch doesn't change any code, just moves stuff from the
	"mach_resources.h" header to a "std_resources.c" subarch specific file, and
	introduces a "std_resources.h" header for the prototypes.

	[PATCH] i386 probe_roms(): fixes
	
	From: Rene Herman <rene.herman@keyaccess.nl>
	
	This patch tries to improve the i386/mach-default probe_roms().  This also
	c99ifies the data, adds an IORESOURCE_IO flag for the I/O port resources,
	an IORESOURCE_MEM flag for the VRAM resource, IORESOURCE_READONLY |
	IORESOURCE_MEM for the ROM resources and adds two additional "adapter ROM
	slots" (for a total of 6) since it now also scans the 0xe0000 segment.

	[PATCH] swsusp update: supports discontingmem/highmem
	
	From: Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
	
	Bill Irwin did some work on this.  It makes swsusp behave correctly w.r.t. 
	discontingmem, and adds highmem handling (very simple-minded, but should work
	ok with 1GB).  It now should behave correctly w.r.t.  more than one swap

	[PATCH] get_user_pages shortcut for anonymous pages
	
	From: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>
	
	The patch avoids the instantiation of pagetables for not-present pages in
	get_user_pages().  Without this, the coredump code can cause total memory
	exhaustion in pagetables.  Consider a store to current stack - 1TB.  The
	stack vma is extended to include this address because of VM_GROWSDOWN.  If
	such a process dies (which is likely for a defunc process) then the elf core
	dumper will cause the system to hang because of too many page tables.
	
	We especially recognise this situation and simply return a ref to the zero
	page.

	[PATCH] Fix Raid5/6 above 2 Terabytes
	
	From: Evan Felix <evan.felix@pnl.gov>
	
	Here is a patch that fixes a major issue in the raid5/6 code.  It seems
	that the code:
	
	logical_sector = bi->bi_sector & ~(STRIPE_SECTORS-1);
	(sector_t)     = (sector_t)    & (constant)
	
	that the right side of the & does not get extended correctly when the
	constant is promoted to the sector_t type.  I have CONFIG_LBD turned on so
	sector_t should be 64bits wide.  This fails to properly mask the value of
	4294967296 (2TB/512) to 4294967296.  in my case it was coming out 0.  this
	cause the loop following this code to read from 0 to 4294967296 blocks so
	it could write one character.
	
	As you might imagine this makes a format of a 3.5TB filesystem take a very
	long time.

	[PATCH] do_fork() error path memory leak
	
	From: <john.l.byrne@hp.com>
	
	In do_fork(), if an error occurs after the mm_struct for the child has been
	allocated, it is never freed.  The exit_mm() meant to free it increments
	the mm_count and this count is never decremented.  (For a running process
	that is exitting, schedule() takes care this; however, the child process
	being cleaned up is not running.) In the CLONE_VM case, the parent's
	mm_struct will get an extra mm_count and so it will never be freed.
	
	This patch should fix both the CLONE_VM and the not CLONE_VM case; the test
	of p->active_mm prevents a panic in the case that a kernel-thread is being
	cloned.

	[PATCH] Fix More Problems Introduced By Module Structure Added in modpost.c
	
	From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
	
	Sam Ravnborg found these.
	
	1) have_vmlinux is a global, and should not be reset every time.
	
	2) We pretend every module needs cleanup_module so it gets versioned,
	   but that isn't defined for CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD=n.
	
	3) The visible effect of this is that modpost will start complaning about
	   undefined symbols - previously this happened only when the module was
	   isntalled.

	[PATCH] kbuild: cleaning in three steps
	
	From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
	
	Previously 'make clean' deleted all automatically generated files.  The
	following patch revert this behaviour, and now 'make clean' leaves enough
	behind to allow external modules to be built.
	
	The cleaning is now done in three steps:
	
	make clean     - delete everything not needed for building external modules
	make mrproper  - delete all generated files, including .config
	make distclean - delete all temporary files such as *.orig, *~, *.rej etc.
	
	This fixes reports about nvidia and vmware build issues.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] kbuild: external module support
	
	From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
	
	Based on initial patch from Andreas Gruenbacher there is now better support
	for building external modules with kbuild.
	
	The preferred syntax is now:
	make -C $KERNELSRC M=$PWD
	
	but the old syntax:
	make -C $KERNELSRC SUBDIRS=$PWD modules
	will remain supported.
	
	The major differences compared to before are that:
	1) No attempt is made to neither check nor update any files in $KERNELSRC
	2) Module versions are now supported
	
	During stage 2 of kernel compilation where the modules are built, a new file
	Module.symvers is created.  This file contains the version for all symbols
	exported by the kernel and any module compiled within the kernel tree.
	
	When the external module is build the Module.symvers file is being read and
	symbol versions are used from that file.
	
	The purpose of avoiding any updates in the kernel src is that usually in a
	distribution the kernel src will be read-only, and there is no need to try to
	update it.  And when building an external module the focus is on the module,
	not the kernel.
	
	I expect the distributions will start using something like this:
	
	kernel src - with no generated files. Not even .config:
	/usr/src/linux-<version>
	
	Output from build:
	/lib/modules/linux-<version>/build
	
	where build is a real directory with relevant output files and the
	appropriate .config.
	
	I have some Documentation in the pipe-line, but wants to see how this
	approach is received before completing it.
	
	This patch is made on top of the previously posted patch to divide
	make clean in three steps.
	
	And you may need to edit the following line in the patch to make it apply:
	 %docs: scripts_basic FORCE
	to
	 %docs: scripts FORCE

	also the clock cycle counter (CCNT) allowing for upto 5 usable counters.
	
	The code has been developed and tested on an IOP331 (hardware courtesy of
	Intel) therefore i haven't been able to test it on XScale PMU1 systems. 
	Testing on said systems would be appreciated, and if done, please uncomment
	the #define DEBUG line at the top of op_model_xscale.c
	
	OProfile userspace support has already been committed and should be
	available via CVS.

	[PATCH] I2C: pwm support in w83781d.c
	
	Here is a general pwm support cleanup patch for the w83781d chip driver.
	Featuring:
	
	* Don't pretend that we handle PWM on AS99127F chips. We don't know how
	it works, and one of the register we are accessing for now is clearly
	not a PWM register, and changing its value usually breaks temperature
	readings.
	
	* Discard irrelevant comments.
	
	* Rewrite show_pwmenable_reg. It was obviously taken from the 2.4
	driver, with unneeded tests and the code was much too complicated
	anyway. And now we handle errors correctly.
	
	* Initialize pwm_enable at load time. So far it was done conditionally
	(if init=1) while it should always be done. And pwm2_enable wasn't read
	from the chip, while it should.
	
	I could test that my AS99127F doesn't expose pwm files through ssysfs
	anymore. Which means that I couldn't test the rest of the pwm changes,
	unfortunately.
	
	I've applied similar changes to our 2.4/CVS repository.

	[PATCH] I2C: No reset not limit init in via686a
	
	The following patch removes limits initialization in the via686a driver.
	It was decided some times ago that this belongs to user-space, not
	kernel. See the thread here:
	http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg06134.html
	
	It also prevents the sensor chip from being savagely reset at load time.
	This too follows a decision taken long ago that drivers should do as
	little as possible in their init procedure. See the thread here:

	[PATCH] Fix sysfs class support for CAPI
	
	this patch fixes a bug in the CAPI TTY support, because the ->name value
	of the TTY driver shouldn't contain a "/". After changing this there are
	now a "capi20" TTY device and a "capi20" control device and so I renamed
	the control device to "capi". The userspace visible part must be done by
	udev and I added these two rules to restore the old namespace:
	
		# CAPI devices
		KERNEL="capi",          NAME="capi20", SYMLINK="isdn/capi20"
		KERNEL="capi*",         NAME="capi/%n"

	[PATCH] kbuild: Create .tmp_versions when building external modules
	
	From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
	
	When building external modules the $PWD/.tmp_versions directory is used.
	The .tmp_versions directory in the kernel tree cannot be used because this
	would clutter up the kernel tree especially when more than one external
	module is being build for the same kernel tree.
	
	This patch make sure to create $PWD/.tmp_versions, and to delete it during
	make clean.  It also removes warning about 'messed with SUBDIRS', this is
	no longer relevant when .tmp_versions is made outside the kernel tree.

	. implement wait_until_sent, some ColdFire parts of hardware support
	  for this (again the 5272).
	. correctly use return values from put_user(), get_user() and copy_to_user()
	
	Many of these originaly from kernel janitors.

	[CPUFREQ] Correcting SGTC.  Timer is based upon FSB
	From: Bruno Ducrot <ducrot@poupinou.org>
	
	I think this patch is needed especially if the FSB is around 166MHz or

	* Deduce fsb from cpu_khz and the max multiplier.  It will be given as kHz now,
	  so that frequency associated to a multiplier will be computate more
	  accurately.  Also, we need it for SGTC (see below).
	* Fix how cpuid is computed in powernow_decode_bios().
	* Be more restrictive for PST.  It may be possible (on desktop shipped with
	  low power Athlon models) that FSB can be changed by dip switchs on
	  motherboard for example.
	* Fix computation for SGTC.  It use the bus timer (and then the bus
	  frequency given by fsb).

	* Integrate acpi perflib from Dominik.
	* Use acpi if the PST tables are known to be broken (ASUS Aspire match one PST,

	[PATCH] USB speedtouch: turn on debugging if CONFIG_USB_DEBUG is set

	[PATCH] USB speedtouch: fix memory leak in error path
	
	Hi Greg, this patch fixes a memory leak in the speedtouch driver.
	The leak occurs when the ATM layer submits a skbuff for transmission,
	but the driver rejects it (because the device has been unplugged for
	example).  The ATM layer requires the driver to free the skbuff in this
	case.  The patch is against your 2.6 kernel tree.

	[PATCH] USB speedtouch: bump the version number

	because it was there...)  The patch is against your 2.6 kernel tree.

	[PATCH] USB: Patch for Clie TH55 Support in visor kernel module
	
	I just want to explain the changes I've made, since I tried to adhere to the
	more organized structure in the 2.6 visor module to incorporate my changes.
	
	I didn't want to pollute this with some ugly hack.
	
	I created a new device id table with name clie_id_5_table to cleanly separate
	the UX50/TH55 from the rest.
	
	Along with this I added a new usb_serial_device_type which is essentially a
	copy of handspring_device but has its own attach function.
	
	This new attach function ( clie_5_attach ) will do the actual magic.
	
	I think it is justified to introduce a new type ( which I called clie_5 )
	since I suspect that Sony is intentionally changing the interface spec ( As
	it has done so in the past ). I dare to predict that we will see more clie
	devices coming this year which will require this new attachment procedure. At
	the moment I am only aware of the UX50 and TH55 to implement that weird
	configuration.

	[PATCH] ext3: journalled quotas
	
	From: Jan Kara <jack@ucw.cz>
	
	Journalled quota support for ext3: The patch consists of two parts - ext3
	changes and changes in generic quota code.  The main idea of the changes is
	that a transaction is always started before any operation which changes quota
	file and dirtifying of the quota causes its write to disk.  These two changes
	assure that quota change is journalled into the same transaction as the file
	change and hence after journal replay quota is consistent with the filesystem
	state.  As during journal replay inodes from orphan list are deleted/truncated
	we have to do quota_on before the replay of the orphan list - this problem is
	solved by additional mount options to ext3 with quota file names and format.
	
	Some changes in generic code were also needed to assure that quota structure
	in file is always allocated and so ordinary quota operations (like
	adding/deleting a block/inode) need only a few blocks from the transaction.

<benh@kernel.crashing.org>
	[PATCH] ppc64: Fix possible duplicate MMU hash entries
	
	The current code has a subtle race where 2 hash PTEs can be inserted
	for the same virtual address for a short period of time. There should
	not be a stale one as the "old" one ultimately gets flushed, but the
	architecture specifies that having two hash PTE is illegal and can
	result in undefined behaviour.
	
	This patch fixes it by never clearing the _PAGE_HASHPTE bit when
	doing test_and_clear_{young,dirty}. That means that subsequent faults
	on those pages will have a bit more overhead to "discover" that the
	hash entry was indeed evicted.
	
	It also adds a small optisation to avoid doing the atomic operation
	and the hash flush in test_and_clear_dirty when the page isn't dirty
	or when setting write protect while it's already set.

<benh@kernel.crashing.org>

	[PATCH] fix 4k irqstacks on x86 (and add voyager support)
	
	There's a bug in the x86 code in that it sets the boot CPU to zero.
	
	This isn't correct since some subarch's use physically indexed CPUs. 
	However, subarchs have either set the boot cpu before irq_INIT() (or
	just inherited the default zero from INIT_THREAD_INFO()), so it's safe
	to believe current_thread_info()->cpu about the boot cpu.

	[PCMCIA] Conversion to module_param
	
	Patch from: Pavel Roskin
	
	As it turns out, mixing MODULE_PARM and module_param in one module is
	wrong.  The parameters specified in module_param are ignored.  I've just
	posted a patch to LKML that will detect this condition and warn about it.
	
	The new debugging code used the new-style module_param, which means that
	all instances of MODULE_PARM should be converted.  The attached patch does
	that.
	
	An additional bonus is that module_param_array provides the number of
	array elements.  This allowed me to change tcic.c and i82365.c to use
	this number for IRQ list.  This change was tested with i82365.  If
	"irq_list" is not specified, irq_list_count is 0.
	
	I set all permissions to 0444 to be safe.  I think we have no secrets
	from the users regarding those parameters.  If some parameters can be
	changed safely at the runtime, the permissions could be changed to 0644.
	I didn't examine how safe (and how useful) it would be, so it's 0444 for
	now.

	[PATCH] reiserfs: fsync() speedup
	
	From: Chris Mason <mason@suse.com>
	
	Updates the reiserfs-logging improvements to use schedule_timeout instead of
	yield when letting the transaction grow a little before forcing a commit for
	fsync/O_SYNC/O_DIRECT.
	
	Also, when one process forces a transaction to end and plans on doing the
	commit (like fsync), it sets a flag on the transaction so the journal code
	knows not to bother kicking the journal work queue.
	
	queue_delayed_work is used so that if we get a bunch of tiny transactions
	ended quickly, we aren't constantly kicking the work queue.
	
	These significantly improve reiserfs performance during fsync heavy

	[PATCH] ARM-related ptep_to_address() fix
	
	From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
	
	rmk mentioned that ARM was borked as the relation, assumed by generic rmap,
	PTRS_PER_PTE*sizeof(pte_t) == PAGE_SIZE, fails to hold.  The following
	patch, developed jointly with him (or depending on POV, by him with me
	acting as codemonkey), is reported to resolve the issue.
	
	Specifically, while ARM dedicates an entire PAGE_SIZE -sized block of
	memory to each PTE table, the PTE table itself only spans half that, the
	remainder being dedicated to hardware-interpreted structures.  As the
	hardware structure must be contiguous, wider ptes can't be used.  So the
	core-visible PTE table only spans PAGE_SIZE/2 bytes, violating the
	assumption.  This corrects masking and scaling done in ptep_to_address().

	[PATCH] Fix vma corruption
	
	It occurred to me that if vma and new_vma are one and the same, then
	vma_relink_file will not do a good job of linking it after itself - in
	that pretty unlikely case when move_page_tables fails.
	
	And more generally, whenever copy_vma's vma_merge succeeds, we have no
	guarantee that old vma comes before new_vma in the i_mmap lists, as we
	need to satisfy Rajesh's point: that ordering is only guaranteed in the
	newly allocated case.
	
	We have to abandon the ordering method when/if we move from lists to
	prio_trees, so this patch switches to the less glamorous use of
	i_shared_sem exclusion, as in my prio_tree mremap.

	[PATCH] rmap: flush_dcache revisited
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	One of the callers of flush_dcache_page is do_generic_mapping_read, where
	file is read without i_sem and without page lock: concurrent truncation may
	at any moment remove page from cache, NULLing ->mapping, making
	flush_dcache_page liable to oops.  Put result of page_mapping in a local
	variable and apply mapping_mapped to that (if we were to check for NULL
	within mapping_mapped, it's unclear whether to say yes or no).
	
	parisc and arm do have other locking unsafety in their i_mmap(_shared)
	searching, but that's a larger issue to be dealt with down the line.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] rmap: swap_unplug page
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	Good example of "swapper_space considered harmful": swap_unplug_io_fn was
	originally designed for calling via swapper_space.backing_dev_info; but
	that way it loses track of which device is to be unplugged, so had to
	unplug all swap devices.  But now sync_page tests SwapCache anyway, can
	call swap_unplug_io_fn with page, which leads direct to the device.
	
	Reverted -mc4's CONFIG_SWAP=n fix, just add another NOTHING for it.
	Reverted -mc3's editorial adjustments to swap_backing_dev_info and
	swapper_space initializations: they document the few fields which are
	actually used now, as comment above them says (sound of slapped wrist).

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] rmap: nonlinear truncation
	
	From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
	
	The earlier changes introducing PageAnon left truncated pages mapped into
	nonlinear vmas unswappable.  Once we go to object-based rmap, it's
	impossible to find where file page is mapped once page->mapping cleared:
	switching them to anonymous is odd, and breaks strict commit accounting.
	
	So now handle truncation of nonlinear vmas correctly.  And factor in
	Daniel's cluster filesystem needs while we're there: when invalidating
	local cache, we do want to unmap shared pages from all mms, but we do not
	want to discard private COWed modifications of those pages (which
	truncation discards to satisfy the SIGBUS semantics demanded by specs).
	
	Drew from Daniel's patch (LKML 2 Mar 04), but didn't always follow it;
	fewer name changes, but still some - "unmap" rather than "invalidate".
	zap_page_range is not exported, safe to give it and all the too-many layers
	an extra zap_details arg, in normal cases just NULL.
	
	Given details, zap_pte_range checks page mapping or index to skip anon or
	untruncated pages.  I didn't realize before implementing, that in nonlinear
	case, it should set a file pte when truncating - otherwise linear pages
	might appear in place of SIGBUS.  I suspect this implies that ->populate
	functions ought to set file ptes beyond EOF instead of failing, but haven't
	changed them as yet.
	
	To avoid making yet another copy of that ugly linear pgidx test, added
	inline function linear_page_index (to pagemap.h to get PAGE_CACHE_SIZE,
	though as usual things don't really work if it differs from PAGE_SIZE). 
	Ooh, I thought I'd removed ___add_to_page_cache last time, do so now.
	
	unmap_page_range static, shift its hugepage check up into sole caller
	unmap_vmas.  Killed "killme" debug from unmap_vmas, not seen it trigger.
	unmap_mapping_range is exported without restriction: I'm one of those who
	believe it should be generally available.  But I'm wrongly placed to decide
	that, probably just sob quietly to myself if _GPL added later.

	Hrm, I believe you could use this to read 128k of kernel memory.
	sdla_read() takes len as a short, whereas mem.len is an int.  So,
	if mem.len == 0x20000, the allocation could still succeed.  When cast
	to short, len will be 0x0, causing the read loop to copy nothing into
	the buffer.  At least it's protected by a capable() check.  I don't
	know what proper upper bound is for this hardware, or how much it's
	used/cared about.  Simple memset() is trivial fix.

	[PATCH] remove redundant check in de2104x ->get_regs()
	
	Trivial patchlet...ethtool core already caps regs.len at a max of

			regs.len = reglen;
	
	So doing the same in the in de2104x driver ->get_regs() is redundant.
	Patch below simply removes it to clarify the guarantee of the API.

	[PATCH] Mixed PCI/ISA device name conflicts
	
	In systems with mixed network cards, and all drivers compiled into
	the kernel; the PCI device (eth0) will get probed first, before the ISA.
	
	The problem is that the ISA device can mistakenly try to probe
	for eth0.  The problem is that the ISA driver will not detect the failure
	until it goes to call register_netdevice, and not all drivers have
	perfect error unwind code.
	
	This patch short circuits the device probe, so it won't bother

	[PATCH] Tulip endianess fix
	
	My tulip ethernet card doesn't work on Blue&White G3 PowerMac with Linux
	2.6.5-rc2.  The card is shown by lspci as
	
	01:03.0 Ethernet controller: Linksys Network Everywhere Fast Ethernet
	10/100 model NC100 (rev 11)
	
	The kernel detects it as "ADMtek Comet rev 17".
	
	The MAC address reported by the kernel looked obviously wrong.  Also, I
	could only ping the system successfully if the interface was in promiscuous
	mode (running Ethereal).
	
	Those two symptoms indicated two different problems - one for reading the
	MAC address from the card on module load (tulip_init_one), and the other
	for writing the address to the card when the interface was brought up
	(tulip_up).  I have fixed both, and here's the explanation:
	
	tulip_init_one:
	
	When reading the first 4 bytes of the address, inl() returns the same data
	to the CPU on all platforms, interpreting the data from the lowest port
	address as the least significant byte.  In other words, I/O is little
	endian on all platforms; it's the memory that differs across platforms.
	We want to write the data to memory preserving little-endianness of the
	PCI bus.  To force little endian write to the memory, the data should be
	converted to the little endian format.
	
	When reading the remaining 2 bytes, the CPU gets them in 2 least
	significant bytes.  To write those 2 bytes to the memory in a 16-bit
	operation, they should be byte-swapped for the 16-bit operation.
	
	tulip_up:
	
	The first 4 bytes are processed correctly, but the code is confusing.
	Reading from memory needs conversion to CPU format, while writing to I/O
	ports doesn't.  So I replaced cpu_to_le32() to le32_to_cpu().
	
	The second 2 bytes are read in a 16-bit memory operation, so they should
	be passed to le16_to_cpu() rather than cpu_to_le32() to make them CPU
	independent and suitable for outl().
	
	
	All those conversions do nothing on little-endian machines, so they should
	not be affected.
	
	The patch has been tested.  The driver is working fine.  ping is OK, ssh
	is OK, X11 over ssh is OK.  Even netconsole is working fine.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
	
	hugepage_vma() is both misleadingly named and unnecessary.  On most archs it
	always returns NULL, and on IA64 the vma it returns is never used.  The
	function's real purpose is to determine whether the address it is passed is a
	special hugepage address which must be looked up in hugepage pagetables,
	rather than being looked up in the normal pagetables (which might have
	specially marked hugepage PMDs or PTEs).
	
	This patch kills off hugepage_vma() and folds the logic it really needs into
	follow_huge_addr().  That now returns a (page *) if called on a special
	hugepage address, and an error encoded with ERR_PTR otherwise.  This also
	requires tweaking the IA64 code to check that the hugepage PTE is present in
	follow_huge_addr() - previously this was guaranteed, since it was only called
	if the address was in an existing hugepage VMA, and hugepages are always
	prefaulted.

	[PATCH] ppc64: siginfo conversion fix

	sys32_rt_sigqueueinfo() which was apparently bogus as well.
	
	After much discussion & debate on the right way of converting that
	structure, I decided to go the sparc64 / s390 way, and not the x86_64
	way, that is to copy the various unions data "as is". This guarantees
	that whatever a 32 bist app passes there, another 32 bits app will
	understand it. Crossover between 32 and 64 bits apps on such things
	as home-made userland siginfo isn't something we can help with anyway.
	
	The x86_64 choice of converting as if it was an RT signal, thus
	converting the sigval, cannot easily be applied to big endian archs
	since the sigval is a union of a ptr and an int, on BE, the int
	happens to be on the wrong half of the 64 bits ptr, thus  we can't
	do a simple conversion.

	[PATCH] fix for potential deadlock after posix-timers change
	
	Ulrich has been working on the glibc code using posix-timers and
	stressing it more now than it has before.  He ran into an SMP deadlock
	on process exit in the case there are pending queued signals from a
	timer.
	
	The deadlock arises because in the path through exit_itimers, the
	tasklist_lock is already held (for writing).  When a timer is being
	deleted, sigqueue_free will try to take it (for reading) in the case
	where that timer has a pending signal queued on somebody's queue.  This
	patch avoids the problem by making sure the queues are flushed before
	calling exit_itimers, thus ensuring its code path won't try to take
	tasklist_lock.

	[PATCH] compute_creds race
	
	From: Andy Lutomirski <luto@myrealbox.com>
	
	Fixes from me, Olaf Dietsche <olaf+list.linux-kernel@olafdietsche.de>
	
	In fs/exec.c, compute_creds does:
	
		task_lock(current);
		if (bprm->e_uid != current->uid || bprm->e_gid != current->gid) {
	                 current->mm->dumpable = 0;
	
			if (must_not_trace_exec(current)
			    || atomic_read(&current->fs->count) > 1
			    || atomic_read(&current->files->count) > 1
			    || atomic_read(&current->sighand->count) > 1) {
				if(!capable(CAP_SETUID)) {
					bprm->e_uid = current->uid;
					bprm->e_gid = current->gid;
				}
			}
		}
	
	         current->suid = current->euid = current->fsuid = bprm->e_uid;
	         current->sgid = current->egid = current->fsgid = bprm->e_gid;
	
		task_unlock(current);
	
		security_bprm_compute_creds(bprm);
	
	I assume the task_lock is to prevent another process (on SMP or preempt)
	from ptracing the execing process between the check and the assignment.  If
	that's the concern then the fact that the lock is dropped before the call
	to security_brpm_compute_creds means that, if security_bprm_compute_creds
	does anything interesting, there's a race.
	
	For my (nearly complete) caps patch, I obviously need to fix this.  But I
	think it may be exploitable now.  Suppose there are two processes, A (the
	malicious code) and B (which uses exec).  B starts out unprivileged (A and
	B have, e.g., uid and euid = 500).
	
	1. A ptraces B.
	
	2. B calls exec on some setuid-root program.
	
	3. in cap_bprm_set_security, B sets bprm->cap_permitted to the full
	   set.
	
	4. B gets to compute_creds in exec.c, calls task_lock, and does not
	   change its uid.
	
	5. B calls task_unlock.
	
	6. A detaches from B (on preempt or SMP).
	
	7. B gets to task_lock in cap_bprm_compute_creds, changes its
	   capabilities, and returns from compute_creds into load_elf_binary.
	
	8. load_elf_binary calls create_elf_tables (line 852 in 2.6.5-mm1),
	   which calls cap_bprm_secureexec (through LSM), which returns false (!).
	
	9. exec finishes.
	
	The setuid program is now running with uid=euid=500 but full permitted
	capabilities.  There are two (or three) ways to effectively get local root
	now:
	
	1.  IIRC, linux 2.4 doesn't check capabilities in ptrace, so A could
	   just ptrace B again.
	
	2. LD_PRELOAD.
	
	3.  There are probably programs that will misbehave on their own under
	   these circumstances.
	
	Is there some reason why this is not doable?
	
	The patch renames bprm_compute_creds to bprm_apply_creds and moves all uid
	logic into the hook, where the test and the resulting modification can both
	happen under task_lock().
	
	This way, out-of-tree LSMs will fail to compile instead of malfunctioning. 
	It should also make life easier for LSMs and will certainly make it easier
	for me to finish the cap patch.

	[PATCH] Call populate_rootfs later in boot
	
	populate_rootfs() is called rather early - before we've called init_idle().
	
	But populate_rootfs() does file I/O, which involves calls to cond_resched(),
	and downing of semaphores, etc.  If it scheules, the scheduler emits
	scheduling-while-atomic warnings and sometimes oopses.
	
	So run populate_rootfs() later, after the scheduler is all set up.

	[PATCH] lockfs - vfs bits
	
	From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>

	Remove all the code now in the VFS, make XFS's freeze ioctls use the new

	This code needs some work so the source files shared with 2.4 aren't
	exposed to the new VFS interfaces directly.  You'll get an update once this
	has been discussed with the other XFS developers and is implemented.  Note
	that the current patch works fine and I wouldn't complain if it gets into
	Linus' tree as-is.

	[PATCH] selinux: change context_to_sid handling for no-policy case
	
	From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
	
	This patch changes the behavior of security_context_to_sid in the no-policy
	case so that it simply accepts all contexts and maps them to the kernel SID
	rather than rejecting anything other than an initial SID.  The change avoids
	error conditions when using SELinux in permissive/no-policy mode, so that any
	file contexts left on disk from prior use of SELinux with a policy will not
	cause an error when they are looked up and userspace attempts to set contexts
	can succeed.

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] selinux: add runtime disable
	
	From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
	
	This patch adds a kernel configuration option that enables writing to a new
	selinuxfs node 'disable' that allows SELinux to be disabled at runtime prior
	to initial policy load.  SELinux will then remain disabled until next boot.
	This option is similar to the selinux=0 boot parameter, but is to support
	runtime disabling of SELinux, e.g.  from /sbin/init, for portability across
	platforms where boot parameters are difficult to employ (based on feedback by
	Jeremy Katz).

	[PATCH] selinux: remove hardcoded policy assumption from get_user_sids() logic
	
	From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
	
	This patch removes a hardcoded policy assumption from the get_user_sids logic
	in the SELinux module that was preventing it from returning contexts that had
	the same type as the caller even if the policy allowed such a transition.  The
	assumption is not valid for all policies, and can be handled via policy
	configuration and userspace rather than hardcoding it in the module logic.

	[PATCH] i386 hugetlb tlb correction
	
	From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
	
	i386 does hardware interpretation of pagetables, so pte_clear() can't be
	used on present ptes, as it sets the upper half of the hugepte prior to
	setting the lower half (which includes the valid bit).  i.e.  there is a
	window where having a hugepage mapped at 56GB and doing pte_clear() in
	unmap_hugepage_range() allows other threads of the process to see a
	hugepage at 0 in place of the original hugepage at 56GB.
	
	This patch corrects the situation by using ptep_get_and_clear(), which
	clears the lower word of the pte prior to clearing the upper word.
	
	There is another nasty where huge_page_release() needs to wait for TLB
	flushes before returning the hugepages to the free pool, analogous to the
	issue tlb_remove_page() and tlb_flush_mm() repair.

	[PATCH] loop_set_fd() sendfile check fix
	
	From: Yury Umanets <torque@ukrpost.net>

	loop back device driver never calls it.  It uses ->sendfile() from backing
	store file.

	[PATCH] removal of MOD_{INC,DEC}_USE_COUNT in ide-cs.c
	
	From: Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
	
	The "ide-cs" module cannot be unloaded because it uses obsolete
	MOD_INC_USE_COUNT and MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT macros.  In fact, they are not
	needed in ide-cs.c in 2.6 kernels.  The generic PCMCIA code already
	increases use count for every device served by the driver, so it's
	impossible to unload the ide-cs driver while it's in use.
	
	I was told that the removal of IDE interfaces may be unsafe in 2.6
	kernels.  However, MOD_INC_USE_COUNT only prevents removal of the module,
	not the interface.  It's also the first obstacle, albeit a trivial one,
	for anybody debugging those problems (i.e. loading a modified module
	requires "rmmod -f" or reboot to unload the old version).

	[PATCH] atmel wireless update
	
	Fixes to avoid problems when the driver shares an interrupt. These were
	caused because the ISR cannot determine the status of the chip without
	changing its state and the driver was only disabling the interrupts from
	the card during some critical regions. An interrupt originating from
	another device at the wrong moment could run the ISR and corrupt chip
	state. Fixed by blocking interupts in the processor in critical regions
	and never checking the chip interrupt status before the driver is fully
	up.
	
	
	Added the ability to override the Regulatory Domain stored in ROM. The
	following command achieves this
	
	iwpriv <interface> regdomain <domain>
	
	vaild domains are USA,Canada,Europe,Spain,France,MKK,MKK1,Israel

	[PATCH] pcmcia netdev ordering fixes
	
	From: Russell King <rmk+pcmcia@arm.linux.org.uk>
	
	This is an *untested* patch (PCMCIA people, please test) to fix
	initialisation ordering issues in these network device drivers.  I don't
	have the hardware to be able to test these changes, although it passes a
	modular build without warnings.
	
	Andrew - it may be worth sticking these in -mm so they get some visibility
	via your tree as well.
	
	Many of these drivers were calling register_netdev() before they had
	completed their initialisation.
	
	In addition, they were calling register_netdev with the
	"DEV_CONFIG_PENDING" flag still set, which prevents hotplug scripts from
	bringing up the interface.
	
	Also, we take care to ensure that link->dev is correctly set - this is used
	to tell the PCMCIA release code if the netdev is currently registered (yes,
	that's probably racy at present, but lets sort one problem at a time.)
	
	I've arranged that all drivers register the netdevice as close as possible
	to the end of their initialisation, copy the net device's name for cardmgr
	to pass to it's network scripts, and then print out whatever information
	the driver wants to.
	
	Finally, a note about ibmtr - it seemed to assume that cardmgr wanted "tr0"
	or "tr1" depending on the base address, and completely ignoring the real
	device which the netdev layer allocated it.  I've assumed that this is
	wrong (since the netdev name is used in printk messages), and changed it to
	behave the same as the other drivers.

	[PATCH] USB: Important bugfix for UHCI list management code
	
	A major bug in the UHCI driver turned up recently.  Thanks to a lot of
	help from Simone Gotti it was identified and fixed late last week.  It
	turned out to be entirely my fault -- a previous patch had introduced two
	(!) errors.  (A combination of carelessness and a nasty thinko, and
	somehow it passed the regression tests...)
	
	Anyway, it's entirely possible that many of the problems people have been
	seeing are caused by that bug.  This patch is the solution.

	[ARM PATCH] 1824/1: guard against gcc not respecting local variable register assignment
	
	Patch from Nicolas Pitre
	
	The recent discovery of a problem with gcc not always respecting register
	assignment for local variables to be used with inline assembly is worrisome.
	If unnoticed, such problems can cover bugs that might prove hard to find
	especially when the code is right but silently ignored.  This patch adds a

	fail the kernel build if the wrong registers are allocated.

	One case was found when the kernel is compiled with -O2 (instead of the 
	default -Os).  However, all gcc-3.* versions seem to have a problem with 
	this.  Instead of blacklisting them all unconditionally, better just abort
	when a bad case occurs especially since this bad case doesn't seem to
	appear with current default compiler flags.  Depends on patch #1824.

	[ARM PATCH] 1815/1: Generic DMA buffer bouncing support for ARM targets
	
	Patch from Deepak Saxena
	
	Latest (and hopefully last :) patch for generic DMA buffer bouncing.
	
	- Fixed SA1111 dma_needs_bounce
	- Added check for out of bounds buffers.
	- Made dmabounce.c directly implement dma_* API
	
	Note that I didn't do the following:
	
	#ifndef CONFIG_DMABOUNCE
	inline implementations of all functions
	#else
	extern declarations
	#endif
	
	Instead I wrapped it individual in #ifndef/#else blocks to keep the
	comments in the same area as function declarations.  IMHO this makes 
	it easier for someone to go look at the comments if they need to know 
	what a specific API does.

	[PATCH] don't log drive loading failures
	
	This is an old bug that often confuses people, rightfully.
	
	For some laptop and server type cdroms, the drives advertise themselves
	as tray loading even if they are caddy-like or slot-in loaders.  This
	means they cannot insert the media on their own, and this generates a
	5/24/00 error to START_STOP_UNIT.
	
	This prevents the logging of such a failure, and also fixes the
	generation of such a bad command in case the mech type was correctly set
	by the drive.

	[PATCH] ia64: bug w/ shared interrupts
	
	I just ran into a bug introduced by the most recent iosapic.c patch.
	The scenario is a builtin driver is up and running happily.  A module
	loads for a devices that happens to share the same interrupt vector,
	in this case a network driver.  The module calls pci_enable_device()
	as it should, which eventually lands in iosapic_enable_intr().  We
	then proceed to mask the interrupt and kill the device that's already
	running.  As a bonus, request_interrupt() doesn't fix the problem
	because we only call the startup for the interrupt handler on the
	first action attached to the interrupt.
	
	I think the best way out of this is simply to detect when an action is
	already attached to a vector and leave it alone.  This also prevents
	interrupts from moving to other cpus (on boxes w/o irq redirection)
	for no good reason.

	[PATCH] ia64: Remove SN PDA page overflow check

	[PATCH] create singlethread_workqueue()
	
	From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
	
	Workqueues are a great primitive for running things from user context from
	a completely clean environment.  Unfortunately, they currently insist on
	creating one thread per CPU, which is overkill for many situations, so the
	more generic keventd workqueue is used for these.  Recently deadlocks using
	keventd were demonstrated, showing that it is not suitable for all uses.
	
	1) Clean up CPU iterators.  Always a nice touch.
	
	2) Add __create_workqueue() and create_singlethread_workqueue(),
	   keeping source compatibility.
	
	3) Put workqueues in workqueue list even if !CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU (means
	   we need a lock to protect that list).  Now we can tell if a wq is
	   single-threaded using list_empty(&wq->list).
	
	4) For single-threaded workqueues, override CPU in queue_work,
	   delayed_work_timer_fn and flush_workqueue to be 0.  flush_workqueue
	   now does redundant passes for single-threaded workqueues, but the
	   code remains simple.
	
	5) Make create_workqueue_thread return the thread, so we can easily
	   kthread_bind for multi-threaded workqueues.
	
	
	akpm fixes:
	
	- Fix up is_single_threaded() handling
	
	- single-threaded wq thread does not have "/0" appended.

	[PATCH] Use workqueue for call_usermodehelper
	
	From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
	
	call_usermodehelper uses keventd to create a thread, guaranteeing a nice,
	clean kernel thread.  Unfortunately, there is a case where
	call_usermodehelper is called with &bus->subsys.rwsem held (via
	bus_add_driver()), but keventd could be running bus_add_device(), which is
	blocked on the same lock.  The result is deadlock, and it comes from using
	keventd for both.
	
	In this case, it can be fixed by using a completely independent thread for
	call_usermodehelper, or an independent workqueue.  Workqueues have the
	infrastructure we need, so we use one.
	
	Move EXPORT_SYMBOL while we're there, too.
	
	akpm fixes: Make it compile with !CONFIG_KMOD

	From: Chris Wright <chrisw@osdl.org>
	
	Contributions from:
	Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
	Andy Lutomirski <luto@stanford.edu>
	
	During exec the LSM bprm_apply_creds() hooks may tranisition the program to a
	new security context (like setuid binaries).  The security context of the new
	task is dependent on state such as if the task is being ptraced.  
	
	ptrace_detach() doesn't take the task_lock() when clearing task->ptrace.  So
	there is a race possible where a process starts off being ptraced, the
	malicious ptracer detaches and if any checks agains task->ptrace are done more
	than once, the results are indeterminate.
	
	This patch ensures task_lock() is held while bprm_apply_creds() hooks are
	called, keeping it safe against ptrace_attach() races.  Additionally, tests
	against task->ptrace (and ->fs->count, ->files->count and ->sighand->count all
	of which signify potential unsafe resource sharing during a security context
	transition) are done only once the results are passed down to hooks, making it
	safe against ptrace_detach() races.
	
	Additionally:
	
	- s/must_must_not_trace_exec/unsafe_exec/
	- move unsafe_exec() call above security_bprm_apply_creds() call rather than
	  in call for readability.
	- fix dummy hook to honor the case where root is ptracing
	- couple minor formatting/spelling fixes

	[PATCH] Bigger quota hashtable
	
	From: Jan Kara <jack@ucw.cz>
	
	I found out that quota uses hash table with just 43 entries to hash dquot
	entries.  I guess that we can afford using one page for that
	(quotactl(Q_GETQUOTA...), got faster like 3x for 4000 users).  Attached patch
	implements that.

	[PATCH] Per-sb dquot dirty lists
	
	From: Jan Kara <jack@ucw.cz>
	
	When there are lots of dirty dquots the vfs_quota_sync() is too slow (it has
	O(N^2) behaviour).  Attached patch implements list of dirty dquots for each
	superblock and quota type.  Using this lists sync is trivially linear.
	Attached patch is against 2.6.5 with journalled quota and previous patch for

	[PATCH] ppc64: Make finish_device_tree use lmb_alloc, not klimit
	
	From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
	
	finish_device_tree simply allocates nodes by incrementing klimit (ie.  using
	memory on top of the kernel).  Change it to figure out how much memory it
	needs, then use lmb_alloc to allocate that, then fill it in.
	
	This gets rid of the only manipulation of klimit after prom_init.

	[PATCH] ppc64: make_room macro for ppc64 prom.c
	
	From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
	
	copy_device_tree calls inspect_node() which recurses to copy the Open Firmware
	device tree.  It just copied into memory above the kernel for about 8MB, which
	can overwrite the initrd, and/or get truncated on big machines.
	
	The real solution is to allocate memory properly for all the prom_init memory
	users.  However, that's quite a change.  This patch introduces a "make_room"
	macro which inspect_node uses to get memory.  This does the same as before,
	except skips over the initrd if neccessary.

	3) Add more debugging under DEBUG_PROM in case we broke anything.

	[PATCH] ppc64: Move Initrd
	
	From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
	
	This patch moves the initrd when "make_room" runs out of space, rather than
	stepping over it.  The problem with stepping over it is that it gets copied
	with the kernel when this happens, which wastes space.
	
	Also ensures that the initrd isn't where the kernel wants to be moved to: if
	it is, it gets moved out the way.

	[PATCH] slab alignment fixes
	
	From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
	
	Below is a patch that redefines the kmem_cache_alloc `align' argument:
	
	- align not zero: use the specified alignment.  I think values smaller than
	  sizeof(void*) will work, even on archs with strict alignment requirement (or
	  at least: slab shouldn't crash.  Obviously the user must handle the
	  alignment properly).
	
	- align zero:
	* debug on: align to sizeof(void*)
	* debug off, SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN clear: align to sizeof(void*)
	* debug off, SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN set: align to the smaller of
	   - cache_line_size()
	   - the object size, rounded up to the next power of two.
	  Slab never honored cache align for tiny objects: otherwise the 32-byte
	  kmalloc objects would use 128 byte objects.
	
	There is one additional point: right now slab uses ints for the bufctls.
	Using short would save two bytes for each object.  Initially I had used short,
	but davem objected.  IIRC because some archs do not handle short efficiently. 
	Should I allow arch overrides for the bufctls?  On i386, saving two bytes
	might allow a few additional anon_vma objects in each page.

	[PATCH] slab: use order 0 for vfs caches
	
	We have interesting deadlocks when slab decides to use order-1 allocations for
	ext3_inode_cache.  This is because ext3_alloc_inode() needs to perform a
	GFP_NOFS 1-order allocation.
	
	Sometimes the 1-order allocation needs to free a huge number of pages (tens of
	megabytes) before a 1-order grouping becomes available.  But the GFP_NOFS
	allocator cannot free dcache (and hence icache) due to the deadlock problems
	identified in shrink_dcache_memory().
	
	So change slab so that it will force 0-order allocations for shrinkable VFS
	objects.  We can handle those OK.

	http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0306.1/1968.html.
	
	I pinged the author the first time on the 2nd of april but still didn't get
	a reply, then send a patch to Linus to remove it last week but linus
	ignored it.  Here's the patch again:

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] Set module license in mcheck/non-fatal.c
	
	From: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
	
	This patch sets the module license for mcheck/non-fatal.c.  The module
	doesn't work at all without this as one of the symbols it needs is only
	exported as GPL.

	[PATCH] SubmittingPatches diffing update.
	
	From: Zwane Mwaikambo <zwane@arm.linux.org.uk>
	
	A kernel janitor recently got confused by the advice in SubmittingPatches
	and was sending patches with the wrong strip level, i think just about
	everyone would prefer standard patches.  Also mention various patch
	management scripts for batching up large deltas.

	[PATCH] ppc64: remove duplicated mb() and comment from __cpu_up
	
	From: Nathan Lynch <nathanl@austin.ibm.com>

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] SELinux ptrace race fix
	
	From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
	
	Looking again at the SELinux ptrace check, I believe that there is an
	unrelated race due to the fact that the parent link is only updated after
	releasing the task lock in ptrace_attach (and this is necessary as task lock
	doesn't nest with write lock of tasklist_lock).
	
	The patch below changes SELinux to save the tracing process' SID upon a
	successful selinux_ptrace hook call and then use that SID in the ptrace check
	in apply_creds in order to avoid such races.  This allows us to preserve the
	fine-grained process-to-process ptrace check upon exec (vs.  the global
	CAP_SYS_PTRACE privilege => PT_PTRACE_CAP flag used by the capability module)
	while still avoiding races.

	[PATCH] doc: specifiying module parameters
	
	From: "Randy.Dunlap" <rddunlap@osdl.org>
	
	kernel-parameters.txt: add info on how to specify loadable module
	parameters vs.  built-in module parameters

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] kbuild: Improved external module support
	
	From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
	
	The external module support recently introduced caused a number of problems:
	- To build an external module the Module.symvers file was needed
	- To create the Module.symvers file a module was required
	- If Module.symvers was missing kbuild boiled out with an error
	- If vmlinux was missing also the stage 2 of module build failed (make -k)
	- It was not documented what was needed to actually bauild a module
	
	The following patch addresses this by adding the following functionality:
	- Always generate the Module.symvers file
	- Ignore a missing Module.symvers file
	- Add a new target modules_prepare, it prepares the kernel for building
	  external modules, and is also usefull with O=
	- And it adds some more comments to Makefile.modpost, so others may follow
	  it with some luck
	- .modpost.cmd is no longer generated
	
	This should close all reports on issues with respect to building external
	modules with current kernel - which has been identified as kernel problems.

<axboe@suse.de>
	[PATCH] fix SG_IO page leak
	
	We cannot always rely on ->biotail remaining untouched. Currently we
	leak all the pinned user pages when doing cdda ripping at least, so I
	see no way around keeping the bio pointer seperate and passing it back
	in for unmap. Alternatively, we could invent a struct blk_map_data and
	put it on the stack for passing to both map and unmap.

	[PATCH] Fix rwsem contention case on alpha/s390x
	
	Thanks to Dru <andru@treshna.com>, who provided an easy way to reproduce
	the problem.
	
	What we have in lib/rwsem.c:__rwsem_do_wake():
		int woken, loop;
		^^^
	and several lines below:
		loop = woken;
		woken *= RWSEM_ACTIVE_BIAS-RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS;
		woken -= RWSEM_ACTIVE_BIAS;
	
	However, rw_semaphore->count is 64-bit on Alpha, so
	RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS has been defined as -0x0000000100000000L.
	Obviously, this blows up in the write contention case.

	[PATCH] Fix overeager stack-expansion on ppc64
	
	This fix is from Paul Mackerras and was applied in 2.4 sometime late
	last year.
	
	On ppc64, touching addresses between the highest other mapping and the
	stack can cause the stack to be extended way, way down, rather than
	causing a SEGV as you would expect.  This patch only allows the stack
	mapping to be extended to cover addresses actually within the stack
	(as determined by looking at the process's r1).  This fix is ported
	from 2.4
	
	This fixes failures on the LTP's shmdt01, munmap01 and munmap02 tests.

	    * seq_path() calls d_path()
	    * d_path() calls mntput() which might_sleep()
	
	We add a new semaphore protecting insertions/removals in the set of swap
	components + switch of ->start()/->stop() to the same semaphore [fixes
	deadlocks] + trivial cleanup of ->next().

	[PATCH] writeback livelock fix
	
	To avoid various livelocks, the writeback code parks all the dirty inodes onto
	sb->s_io and then works through that list until it is empty.  This assumes
	that each inode will be moved to some other list as it is processed.
	
	But there's a loophole: if the ->writepages() implementation does nothing at
	all, the inode is not redirtied (which would move it to s_dirty).  This causes
	s_io to not empty and pdflush goes nuts.
	
	So when this happens, move the inode onto s_dirty within
	__sync_single_inode().  Use list_move_tail() to attempt to preserve the
	time-ordering of the s_dirty list.

	        this pulls in __constant_c_and_count_memset()

	 But by now it is too late! The compiler has already seen the bare
	 "inline" in string.h, and hasn't inlined it.
	
	Result:

	[PATCH] ppc64: fix incorrect signal handler argument
	
	This fixes a bug in the ppc64 signal delivery code where the signal
	number argument to a signal handler can get corrupted before the handler
	is called.  The specific scenario is that a process is in a blocking
	system call when two signals get generated for it, both of which have
	handlers.
	
	The signal code will stack up two signal frames on the process stack
	(assuming the mask for the first signal delivered doesn't block the
	second signal) and return to userspace to run the handler for the second
	signal.  On return from that handler the first handler gets run with an
	incorrect signal number argument because we end up with regs->result
	still having a negative value (left over from when the system call was
	interrupted) when it should be zero.  This patch sets it to zero when we
	set up the signal frame (in three places; for 64-bit processes, and for
	32-bit processes for RT and non-RT signals). 
	
	The way we handle signal delivery and signal handler return using the
	regs->result field in ppc64 is more complicated than it needs to be.  In
	ppc32 I have already simplified it and eliminated use of the
	regs->result field.  I am going to do the same in the ppc64 code, but I
	think this patch should go in for now to fix the bug. 
	
	The patch also fixes a couple of places where we were unnecessarily and
	incorrectly truncating the regs->result value to 32 bits
	(sys32_sigreturn and sys32_rt_sigreturn return a long value, as all
	syscalls do, and if regs->result is negative we need those syscalls to
	return a negative value).
	
	Thanks to Maneesh Soni for identifying the specific circumstances
	under which this bug shows up.

	[PATCH] ppc64: Use slbie, not slbia in hugepage code
	
	On PPC64, when we prepare segments below 4G for use with hugepages, we
	need to flush their entries from the SLB, in case SLB entries
	specifying normal pages were already present.
	
	Previously we did that by flushing the entire SLB, the patch below
	changes this to individually flush each necessary segment with slbie.
	The new version may well be slightly faster, but the real reason for
	it is so that this code path doesn't need to be changed to reinstate
	any bolted SLB entries, if we add them.  The existing version has
	already caused problems (read, crashes) when combined with some
	patches that add bolted SLB entries.

	The problem was that the linker script was getting included in the list
	of things that got put together to make some of the sorts of bootable
	images that we produce.  This removes ld.script in cases where it wasn't
	appropriate and changes the rules in others so that although we have the
	dependency on ld.script, it doesn't get included in the list of things
	to link.

<alex.williamson@com.rmk.(none)>
	[SERIAL] 8250_hcdp needs irq sharing
	
	Patch from Alex Williamson
	
	Here's a trivial patch that makes 8250_hcdp setup the correct flags
	when IRQ sharing is enabled for serial ports.
	
	The HCDP table tells us if the device is a PCI UART.  We can use this
	to set the shared interrupt flag as well as program the interrupt with
	the correct polarity/trigger (should get rid of "changing vector <x>
	from IO-SAPIC-edge to IO-SAPIC-level" messages at bootup).  This also
	allows non-PCI UARTs to be left un-shareable, which is likely much
	more safe (edge triggered).
	
	The bit that I'm keying on is still part of the older 1.0a HCDP spec,
	so should be implemented (it was on all the boxes I tested).  If
	there's firmware out there that doesn't set this bit or the interrupt
	supported flag, the HCDP UART may run in polling mode, but should
	still be functional.

	[PATCH] fixup for C1 Halt Disconnect problem on nForce2 chipsets
	
	Based on information provided by "Allen Martin" <AMartin@nvidia.com>:
	
	A hang is caused when the CPU generates a very fast CONNECT/HALT cycle

	This allows the state-machine and timer to return to a proper state within

	issue another HALT within 80 ns of the initial HALT, the failure condition
	is avoided.

	[PATCH] bug in bigsmp CPU bringup
	
	There is an bug in bigsmp sub-architecture, due to which it will not
	enable all the CPUs when the BIOS-APICIDs are not 0 to n-1 (where n is
	total number of CPUs). Particularly, only 2 CPU comes up on a system
	that has 4 CPUs with BIOS APICID as (0, 1, 6, 7).=20
	
	The bug is root caused to check_apicid_present(bit) call in smpboot.c,
	when bigsmp is expecting apicid in place of bit.
	check_apicid_present(bit) in bigsmp subarchitecture checks the bit with
	phys_id_present_map (which is actually map representing all apicids and
	not bit).
	
	One solution is to change check_apicid_present(bit) to
	check_apicid_present(apicid), in smp_boot_cpus().  But, it can affect
	all the other subarchitectures in various subtle ways.  So, here is a
	simple alternate fix (Thanks to Martin Bligh), which solves the above
	problem. 
	
	[ Confirmation from Martin:
	
	     Looks fine, it's exactly the same fix we use for Summit.  Since
	     we're using the other method instead of the bitmap, this check
	     isn't needed, so we can just bypass it.  This way also has the
	     great advantage of being isolated to the bigsmp subarch, so it only
	     needs testing there ;-)

	[PATCH] bug fix for megaraid memory leak
	
	I was going through the code looking for bits and pieces to pull across
	into the new LSI Logic beta megaraid driver /sys fs code and came across
	this one.
	
	LSI Logic have already fixed this issue for the 2.4 driver, and the new
	beta driver does not use the /proc filesystem at all, so no problem
	there.
	
	The problem is that resources are not freed upon certain error
	conditions in the in-kernel megaraid driver, to quote from Lester
	Hightower (who originally found the issue):
	
	   "The problem occurs only in the circumstance where one reads one of
	    the /proc/megaraid/hba<X>/diskdrives-ch<N> files where the card <X>
	    does not have channel <N> on it.  Most people would likely not
	    notice this leak in normal operation, but due to the way that we
	    monitor our MegaRaid cards in our company (we read these /proc
	    entries every 180s) so we found the leak rather quickly, and
	    unpleasantly (when your kernel eats all your RAM)."
	
	Anyway, here is the fix, compiled and tested OK for me.

	[PATCH] ncpfs data corruption when using large TCP transfers
	
	ncpfs was forgetting to update iovec's iov_base field whenever partial
	transmission occured. This was causing data corruption during large
	(60kB) writes.
	
	The code now also passes copy of iovec to the sock_sendmsg, so it does
	not rely on network stack updating (or not updating) passed iovec in
	case of success (or failure).

	NTFS: Read the journal ($LogFile) and determine if the volume has been shutdown cleanly

	      is a little bit of a crude check in that we only look at the restart areas and
	      not at the actual log records so that there will be a very small number of cases
	      where we think that a volume is dirty when in fact it is clean.  This should only
	      affect volumes that have not been shutdown cleanly and did not have any pending,

	[PATCH] Suspend IDE disks on shutdown
	
	When Patrick removed ide_notify_reboot() in 2.5.42, he didn't notice
	that it meant that IDE no longer had any shutdown() functionality.
	
	So we did the right thing on suspend, but not on shutdown.
	
	ide_notify_reboot() was only doing STANDBY on shutdown (because FLUSH
	'doesn't work' in 2.4 too) but it worked okay and we still should do STANDBY
	on shutdown because some broken disks flush their caches.
	
	Thus just calls bus->suspend() (FLUSH+STANDBY) at shutdown time.  We can
	add some safety delay later - 2.4 doesn't have any.

	[PATCH] Fix IO bitmap invalidate
	
	There is a bug where if any process that obtained an IO access
	permissions via ioperm() does not explicitly "drop" that permissions,
	the IO permissions don't get properly invalidated on process exit.
	
	The cause is that exit_thread() only invalidates the per-thread
	io_bitmap pointer, but doesn't invalidate the per-TSS io_bitmap pointer
	as well. 
	
	As the per-thread pointer is invalidated, __switch_to() doesn't take
	care of that one either, so the per-TSS pointer stays valid as long as
	some other process does ioperm().
	
	This fixes the problem - it invalidates the per-TSS io_bitmap pointer
	and the problem goes away.

	[PATCH] fix WARN_ON on XFS module unload
	
	From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
	
	This one is a little funny.  The SGI trees don't show this issue because dmapi
	and quota are separate modules so they must be unloaded before xfs_fs_exit can
	be called at all.
	
	So let's move the exitcalls for them in mainline first to simulate that
	behaviour.

	[NET]: Add sock_create_kern()
	
	Under SELinux, and potentially other LSMs, we need to be able to
	distinguish between user sockets and kernel sockets.  For SELinux
	specifically, kernel sockets need to be specially labeled during creation,
	then bypass access control checks (they are controlled by the kernel
	itself and not subject to SELinux mediation).
	
	This addresses a class of potential issues in SELinux where, for example, 
	a TCP NFS session times out, then the kernel re-establishes an RPC 
	connection upon further user activity.  We do not want such kernel 
	created sockets to be labeled with user security contexts.
	
	sock_create() and sock_create_kern() are wrapper functions, which seems 
	semantically clearer to me than e.g. adding a flag to sock_create().  If 
	you prefer the latter, then let me know.
	
	The patch also adds an argument to the LSM socket creation functions
	indicating whether the socket being created is a kernel socket or not.

<jmorris@redhat.com>
	[NET]: Add sock_create_lite()
	
	The purpose of this is to allow sockets created by the kernel in this way
	to be passed through the LSM socket creation hooks and be labeled and
	mediated in the same manner as other sockets.
	
	This patches addresses a class of potential issues with LSMs, where such
	sockets will not be labeled correctly (if at all), or mediated during
	creation.  Under SELinux, it fixes a specific bug where RPC sockets
	created by the kernel during TCP NFS serving are unlabeled.

	[TCP]: BIC TCP for Linux 2.6.6
	
	This is a version of Binary Increase Control (BIC) TCP
	developed by NCSU.   It is yet another TCP congestion control
	algorithm for handling big fat pipes. For normal size congestion
	windows it behaves the same as existing TCP Reno, but when window
	is large it uses additive increase to ensure fairness and when
	window is small it uses binary search increase.
	
	For more details see the BIC TCP web page
	 http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/rhee/export/bitcp/
	
	The original code was for web100 (2.4); this version is pretty
	much the same but targeted for 2.6 with less sysctl parameters 
	and more constants.
	
	I don't have a real high speed long haul network to test, but
	when running over 1G links with delays, the performance is more stable
	(ie tests are repeatable) and as fast as existing Reno.

	I moved this a little too late - we need to run populate_rootfs() before

	The populate_rootfs() call is still coming after init_idle(), so it won't
	knock the scheduler over.

	Waste less memory in dentries.
	
	We don't bother aligining them on a cacheline boundary, since

	Instead, we make the minimum inline string size a bit longer,
	and re-order a few fields that allow for better packing on
	64-bit architectures, for better memory utilization.
