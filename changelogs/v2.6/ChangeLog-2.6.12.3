    [PATCH] uml: fix TT mode by reverting "use fork instead of clone"
    
    From: Jeff Dike <jdike@addtoit.com>, Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
    
    Revert the following patch, because of miscompilation problems in different
    environments leading to UML not working *at all* in TT mode; it was merged
    lately in 2.6 development cycle, a little after being written, and has caused
    problems to lots of people; I know it's a bit too long, but it shouldn't have
    been merged in first place, so I still apply for inclusion in the -stable
    tree. Anyone using this feature currently is either using some older kernel
    (some reports even used 2.6.12-rc4-mm2) or using this patch, as included in my
    -bs patchset.
    
    For now there's not yet a fix for this patch, so for now the best thing is to
    drop it (which was widely reported to give a working kernel).
    
    "Convert the boot-time host ptrace testing from clone to fork.  They were
    essentially doing fork anyway.  This cleans up the code a bit, and makes
    valgrind a bit happier about grinding it."

    [PATCH] coverity: tty_ldisc_ref return null check
    
    We add a check of the return value of tty_ldisc_ref(), which
    is checked 7 out of 8 times, e.g.:
    
    149  		ld = tty_ldisc_ref(tty);
    150  		if (ld != NULL) {
    151  			if (ld->set_termios)
    152  				(ld->set_termios)(tty, &old_termios);
    153  			tty_ldisc_deref(ld);
    154  		}
    
    This defect was found automatically by Coverity Prevent, a static analysis
    tool.
    
    (akpm: presumably `ld' is never NULL.  Oh well)

    [PATCH] v4l cx88 hue offset fix
    
    Changed hue offset to 128 to correct behavior in cx88 cards.  Previously,
    setting 0% or 100% hue was required to avoid blue/green people on screen.
    Now, 50% Hue means no offset, just like bt878 stuff.

    [PATCH] tpm breaks 8139cp
    
    A problem was reported that the tpm driver was interfereing with
    networking on the 8139 chipset.  The tpm driver was using a hard coded
    the memory address instead of the value the BIOS was putting the chip
    at.  This was in the tpm_lpc_bus_init function.  That function can be
    replaced with querying the value at Vendor specific locations.  This
    patch replaces all calls to tpm_lpc_bus_init and the hardcoding of the
    base address with a lookup of the address at the correct vendor
    location.

    [PATCH] ppc32: stop misusing ntps time_offset value
    
    As part of my timeofday rework, I've been looking at the NTP code and I
    noticed that the PPC architecture is apparently misusing the NTP's
    time_offset (it is a terrible name!) value as some form of timezone offset.
    
    This could cause problems when time_offset changed by the NTP code.  This
    patch changes the PPC code so it uses a more clear local variable:
    timezone_offset.

    That zero just means that nothing else found any irq information either.
