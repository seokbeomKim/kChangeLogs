<gregkh@suse.de>
	Cset exclude: khali@linux-fr.org[gregkh]|ChangeSet|20050430010004|65088
	
	Revert the msdos.c patch as it causes more problems than it helps right now.
	(it got munged together with the i2c patch also, stupid scripts...)

<khali@linux-fr.org>
	[PATCH] I2C: Fix incorrect sysfs file permissions in it87 and via686a drivers
	
	The it87 and via686a hardware monitoring drivers each create a sysfs
	file named "alarms" in R/W mode, while they should really create it in
	read-only mode. Since we don't provide a store function for these files,
	write attempts to these files will do something undefined (I guess) and
	bad (I am sure). My own try resulted in a locked terminal (where I
	attempted the write) and a 100% CPU load until next reboot.
	
	As a side note, wouldn't it make sense to check, when creating sysfs
	files, that readable files have a non-NULL show method, and writable
	files have a non-NULL store method? I know drivers are not supposed to
	do stupid things, but there is already a BUG_ON for several conditions
	in sysfs_create_file, so maybe we could add two more?

	[PATCH] Remove bogus BUG() in kernel/exit.c
	
	Remove bogus BUG() in kernel/exit.c
	
	It's old sanity checking that may have been useful for debugging, but
	is just bogus these days.
	
	Noticed by Mattia Belletti.
