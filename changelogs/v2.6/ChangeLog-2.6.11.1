	[PATCH] Fix for trivial fix for 2.6.11 raid6 compilation on ppc w/ Altivec
	
	Here's a patch that will work for both PPC and PPC64. The proper way to
	fix this in mainline is to merge -mm's cpu_has_feature patch, but for
	the stable 2.6.11-series, this much less intrusive (i.e. just the pure
	bugfix, not the cleanup part).

	[PATCH] Fix keyboards for Dell machines
	
	Some ACPI-related changes were recently made to i8042 discovery for ia64.
	Unfortunately this broke a significant number of Dell laptops due to their
	having incorrect BIOS tables.
	
	So, for now, arrange for the new code to be ia64-only.
