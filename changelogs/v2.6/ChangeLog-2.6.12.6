    [PATCH] sg.c: fix a memory leak in devices seq_file implementation (2nd)
    
    I know that scsi procfs is legacy code but this is a fix for a memory leak.
    
    While reading through sg.c I realized that the implementation of
    /proc/scsi/sg/devices with seq_file is leaking memory due to freeing the
    pointer returned by the next() iterator method. Since next() might
    return NULL or an error this is wrong. This patch fixes it through using
    the seq_files private field for holding the reference to the iterator
    object.
    
    Here is a small bash script to trigger the leak. Use slabtop to watch
    the size-32 usage grow and grow.
    
    #!/bin/sh
    
    while true; do
    	cat /proc/scsi/sg/devices > /dev/null
    done

    [PATCH] Revert unnecessary zlib_inflate/inftrees.c fix
    
    It turns out that empty distance code tables are not an error, and that
    a compressed block with only literals can validly have an empty table
    and should not be flagged as a data error.
    
    Some old versions of gzip had problems with this case, but it does not
    affect the zlib code in the kernel.

    [PATCH] NPTL signal delivery deadlock fix
    
    This bug is quite subtle and only happens in a very interesting
    situation where a real-time threaded process is in the middle of a
    coredump when someone whacks it with a SIGKILL. However, this deadlock
    leaves the system pretty hosed and you have to reboot to recover.
    
    Not good for real-time priority-preemption applications like our
    telephony application, with 90+ real-time (SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR)
    processes, many of them multi-threaded, interacting with each other for
    high volume call processing.
