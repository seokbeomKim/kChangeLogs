<tony@cantech.net.au> (02/04/17 1.531.4.1)
	[PATCH] Change "return EBLAH" to "return -EBLAH in drivers/*
	
	Hello All,
		This is a simple patch that changes several "return EBLAH"'s in drivers/*
	for "return -EBLAH".  I have done my best to check the call stack to ensure
	that the change in sign of the return values wont break anything.
	
	The patch supplied is agaist linux-2.4.19-pre6

<oliver@neukum.name> (02/04/19 1.531.4.2)

<greg@kroah.com> (02/04/19 1.531.4.4)
	USB core
	
	Took out the limitation that drivers had to take up 16 minors.  Now
	they can use only 1 if they want to.

<mark@hal9000.dyndns.org> (02/04/22 1.537)
	This updates the ov511 driver to the latest stable version (1.60).
	  
	  Summary of changes:
	  - Remove palette conversion and related code
	  - Full OV518 support (except for color), initial OV518+ support
	  - Improved OV6620 quality (Credit: Alexandre F.)
	  - ov51x_init_isoc() should exit if usb_submit_urb() fails
	  - ISO completion handler should only issue warning if bad data is received
	  - Added "mirror" module parameter; reverses image horizontally
	  - Changed USB control transaction fields to match Windows driver
	  - New decompression module locking (decomp_ops->owner), per Greg's advice
	  - EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS => EXPORT_SYMBOL
	  - New devices: Lifeview USB Live TV PAL/SECAM and PAL D/K+B/G
	  - Disabled buf_timeout feature. It was calling vfree() in interrupt
	    context, which is illegal. Memory is deallocated immediately on close().
	  - Most sensors thought to be OV7620AE were actually OV76BE. Changed code
	    to reflect this, and emit a warning if an OV7620AE is encountered.
	  - Miscellaneous cleanups and bug fixes

	  	- removed commented out function prototypes
	  	- removed duplicate function prototypes
	  	- removed unneeded #include
	  	- added named initializers
	  	- merged lots of the individual device structures into general 1, 2, and 4 port structures.

<david-b@pacbell.net> (02/04/22 1.541)
	[PATCH] PATCH: 2.5.8 ehci, submit errors
	
	It fixes problems with interrupt transfers, which I think that
	nobody else has run into (or I'd surely have heard of it :).
	Looks like not many folk are using USB 2.0 hubs yet.
	
	    - wasn't checking enough of the periodic schedule to
	      detect bandwidth overcommit (would BUG out)
	    - frames to uframes is rightshift 3, not 8 :)
	    - properly cleans up (no oops!) after certain rare errors
	      in the interrupt submit path (just my luck to hit one)
	    - use that cleanup to bypass some old implementation
	      shortcuts in the control and bulk submit paths
	    - there are also some other minor updates/cleanups

<david-b@pacbell.net> (02/04/22 1.542)
	[PATCH] Re: PATCH: 2.5.8 ehci, submit errors
	
	Oh, and for non-x86 platforms with interesting pci
	mapping, this tweak to one new routine would be
	important in a particular error path I've yet to see ... :)

<dkuhlen@fhm.edu> (02/04/22 1.543)
	[PATCH] fix USB documentation bug
	
	USB fix documentation bug
	
	 After some source investigations I discovered a harmless mistake:
	 The description of the  usb_control_msg(...) function says
	 it returns 0, or less than 0 if an error occured, but
	 the usb_internal_control_msg returns length, which is sometimes >0
	 (success) or <0 if error.

<kai@tp1.ruhr-uni-bochum.de> (02/04/22 1.531.7.1)
	Remove one occurence of list-multi in drivers/isdn/tpam/Makefile

<kai@tp1.ruhr-uni-bochum.de> (02/04/22 1.531.7.2)
	Remove list-multi in drivers/net/*/Makefile

<kai@tp1.ruhr-uni-bochum.de> (02/04/22 1.531.7.3)
	Remove list-multi in sound/*/Makefile

<torvalds@home.transmeta.com> (02/04/22 1.544.2.1)
	Duh. Re-fix the UP setup_per_cpu_areas() case that got
	fixed a few times too many already ;)

<anton@samba.org> (02/04/22 1.544.2.2)
	[PATCH] double down() in nfsd_symlink
	
	As a result of the recent BKL removal in notify_change, nfsd_symlink
	downs the inode semaphore twice (the first time is in fh_lock).

<kai@tp1.ruhr-uni-bochum.de> (02/04/23 1.547)
	Fix a typo which left aic7xxx/Makefile broken
	
	Now it really works (I tried).

<torvalds@home.transmeta.com> (02/04/23 1.548)
	Fix some strange (and incorrect) reiserfs bit-op casts..
	
	No object-code changes, but removes warnings from the stricter
	typechecking.

<torvalds@home.transmeta.com> (02/04/23 1.549)
	Add a "const" qualifier to test_bit() on x86, to avoid
	warnings for proper usage.

<torvalds@home.transmeta.com> (02/04/23 1.550)
	Update to version 2.5.10

<torvalds@home.transmeta.com> (02/04/23 1.551)
	Add ATI Radeon 8500 ID

<torvalds@home.transmeta.com> (02/04/23 1.552)

	[PATCH] spelling mistakes
	
	Fix a few spelling mistakes in documentation (arch/i386/boot/setup.S,
	Documentation/sysrq.txt).

<smurf@osdl.org> (02/04/23 1.556)
	[PATCH] MegaRAID - compile fix for 2.5.9
	
	  This fixes compile errors.  It has been tested with a weekend of Bonnie++ 8GB
	runs on a RAID0 setup at the OSDL.  This was built against and tested on 2.5.8
	and applies cleanly to 2.5.9.
	
	  LSI told me they have a version 2.0 of the driver in development but
	it would be really nice to have the dang thing working now ;-)

<ak@muc.de> (02/04/23 1.557)
	[PATCH] x86-64 next sync for 2.5.9
	
	This patch fixes up some lose ends left over from the last x86-64 jumbo merge.
	
	 - make it compile again. ia32_ioctl was referencing IDE ioctls that got
	   remove in a merge race
	 - Use the memset/FXRSTOR way to initialize the FPU, as discussed.
	 - Fix semctl/shmctl ABI (thanks to Andreas Schwab)
	 - Other minor fixes.

<torvalds@home.transmeta.com> (02/04/23 1.558)
	Fix include files for write_super BKL move.
