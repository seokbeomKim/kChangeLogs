Summary of changes from v2.5.73 to v2.5.74
============================================

<dave@thedillows.org>
	Use a non-zero rx_copybreak to avoid charging a full MTU to the
	socket on tiny packets.
	
	Dave Miller suggested 256, I used 200 to be more consistent with the
	other network drivers.

<davej@codemonkey.org.uk>
	[CPUFREQ] speedstep_detect_speed might not reenable interrupts
	
	From Samuel Thibault
	
	local_irq_save() is called at the beginning of speedstep_detect_speeds,
	but local_irq_restore() is not called on I/O errors.

<rmk@flint.arm.linux.org.uk>
	[SERIAL] Fix 8250 revision width.
	
	Patch from wli, edited by rmk.
	
	'rev' needs to be at least 16 bits.

<jgrimm@touki.austin.ibm.com>
	[SCTP] Break out sctp_assoc_valid() from sctp_id2assoc().
	
	sctp_id2assoc() was trying to do too many things.  Break out, so
	sctp_assoc_bh_rcv() can just find out whether the assoc is valid.

<anton@samba.org>
	ppc64: implement any_online_cpu

<paulus@samba.org>
	PPC32: Implement force_successful_syscall_return.
	
	We use a bit in the thread_info flags for this.  The bit is cleared on syscall
	entry and set by force_successful_syscall_return.  If the bit is set on syscall
	exit, the normal check whether the value from the syscall function is an
	error code is disabled and the value is just returned to userspace.

<anton@samba.org>
	ppc64: Fix sysinfo translation, spotted by Dave Miller

<jbarnes@sgi.com>
	[PATCH] ia64: bitshift fix
	
	I think there are other 64p issues in other places, but we found this
	one while doing 2.5 bringup on hardware.

<jbarnes@sgi.com>
	[PATCH] ia64: mark_idle() fixes for sn2
	
	Small patch to fixup the new mark_idle() stuff for sn2.

	Small fix for hwgfs on sn2.

<jbarnes@sgi.com>
	[PATCH] ia64: PCI fixes for sn2
	
	Updates the PCI routines for sn2.

<jbarnes@sgi.com>
	[PATCH] ia64: generic kernel support for sn2
	
	I _think_ I got this one right (at least, it booted on hw).  It should
	allow generic kernels to include the sn2 code.

<davidm@tiger.hpl.hp.com>
	ia64: Drop obsolete ACPI SPCR support.

<davidm@tiger.hpl.hp.com>
	ia64: Two more minor cleanups for 2.5.72.

<chadt@sgi.com>
	[PATCH] ia64: early_printk for SGI SN2
	

<davidm@tiger.hpl.hp.com>
	ia64: Minor cleanups; fix non-SMP build.

<davidm@tiger.hpl.hp.com>
	ia64: Simplify the script to use only $CC and $OBJDUMP.  Besides being simpler,
		this also ensure we really do test the linker which will be
		used when building the gate DSO.

<davidm@tiger.hpl.hp.com>
	Kconfig:
	  Add back IDE configuration.

<jbarnes@sgi.com>
	[PATCH] ia64: sn2 updates for 2.5.72
	
	Here's a patch against your bk tree that keeps things building for sn2
	(and working with the discontig patch applied).

<alext@fc.hp.com>
	[PATCH] ia64: cleanup xor build rule to take advantage of lib-m
	

<davidm@tiger.hpl.hp.com>
	ia64: Fix a alternate-signal-stack bug which could corrupt RNaT bits
		when bspstore happened to point to an RNaT-slot.
		Bug reported by Matt Chapman.

<davidm@wailua.hpl.hp.com>
	ia64: More perfmon fixes:
	         - removes 2.4 specific macros/inline functions
	         - fix rum vs. rsm bug for psr.up
	         - introduce cleaner PMC_IS_CONTROL() macro
	         - only save the value of psr.up on ctxsw (not whole psr)"

<anton@samba.org>
	ppc64: Convert from K+R to ansi

<anton@samba.org>
	ppc64: small __access_ok optimisation

<david-b@pacbell.net>
	[PATCH] USB: GFDL in the kernel tree
	
	I don't care about this enough to argue ...
	
	I attach a patch to make it use the same legalese as
	the other docs.

<greg@kroah.com>
	USB: delete cdc-ether driver as it's no longer needed.

<judd@jpilot.org>

	[PATCH] USB: fix UHCI debug kmalloc() usage
	
	Here's a patch from Tony Luck that fixes a problem with the UHCI
	debugging code on architectures with big page sizes. We end up
	allocating more than kmalloc allows.

	[XFS] if we remount the fs readonly, there is no need to put

	have the effect of dirtying it in a readonly unmount.

	Ok - here we go. Slightly improved patch compared to what I've sent first
	so we handle now failure in create_proc_entry and !CONFIG_PROC_FS
	identical, i.e. continue without proc entry. It's not needed for the
	driver to work.
	
	Updated Changelog:
	
	* make it compile without CONFIG_PROC_FS (problem reported by Adrian Bunk,
	  original patch by Sam Ravnborg)
	* get rid of a number of unneeded ifdef/endif CONFIG_PROC_FS (also
	  removing an "unused label" warning)
	* use proc entrys' owner fields to protect against module removal racing
	  with proc entry access.
	* handle failure in create_proc_entry like !CONFIG_PROC_FS
	* set driver version 0.4a
	
	Jeff, would please forward it for application to 2.5!
	
	Martin

<lord@sgi.com>
	[XFS] make doing an iread from a bad location less chatty by default
	as some code paths can actually do this and handle the result.

	SGI Modid: 2.5.x-xfs:slinx:151422a

	[XFS] SYNC_FSDATA and SYNC_REFCACHE are supposed to be distinct values,
	they ended up the same somehow.
	
	SGI Modid: 2.5.x-xfs:slinx:151227a

<lord@sgi.com>
	[XFS] Move the pagebuf_runall_queues out from under a spinlock, if it
	sleeps (which it might), this is not the right place for it to
	be. There is also no reason for it to be under a spinlock.
	
	SGI Modid: 2.5.x-xfs:slinx:151032a

<lord@sgi.com>
	[XFS] Fix deadlock between xfs_finish_reclaim and xfs_iget_core. An inode being
	reclaimed and removed from memory by one thread while another thread
	is attempting to reuse the inode and bring it back to life. There
	was a window between the iget starting to reuse the inode and the
	reclaim starting. Close the window by marking the inode as being
	reused under the hash lock, and by abandoning the reclaim if this
	is detected when it obtains the hash lock.

	SGI Modid: 2.5.x-xfs:slinx:151423a

<lord@sgi.com>
	[XFS] Fix deadlock caused by race between xfs_iunpin marking an inode
	dirty, and the same inode being reallocated and reused by create.
	The unlock_new_inode and mark_inode_dirty manage to corrupt the
	i_state flags and end up leaving I_LOCK|I_NEW set.

	Done. Also cleaned up the "Override Table" a bit.

	There are some bad compiler issues with section confusion ("const" stuff

	[PATCH] loop.c cleanups
	
	This does the following:
	 - remove trailing spaces
	 - make loop.h independent by including bio.h, blk.h, spinlock.h
	 - replace the lock/unlock functions by module_get/module_put;
	   in struct loop this is the change
		-       void (*lock)(struct loop_device *);
		-       void (*unlock)(struct loop_device *);
		+       struct module *owner;
	 - replace the integer lo_encrypt_type by the pointer lo_encryption;
	   there was a race with loop_unregister_transfer
	 - fixed an off-by-one in loop_register_transfer
	
	This is Step 1 of a series of half a dozen or so.
	
	Half of the above is from Jari. Anything that is wrong is mine.

<ldl@aros.net>
	[PATCH] fix nbd driver for 2.5 block layer
	
	This makes NBD work with the new linux 2.5 block layer design.
	Specifically, it fixes memory corruption that results from module
	removal and possible memory corruption from sending or receiving disk
	data from the server.
	
	It essentially rolls together the changes from two of the last patchlets
	that I emailed: the fix for module removal & the fix for incorrect
	struct bio usage.  I believe it's wisest to roll these both together
	into this one patch since they both deal with making NBD work better
	with the 2.5 linux block layer design and without either of which, it's
	possible that NBD will corrupt memory.
	
	Other changes I'd like to see introduced (like in the earlier jumbo
	patch) meanwhile are feature enhancements so they can wait.  This patch
	also should address all the very helpful concerns that have been raised
	so far.  Particularly:
	
	1. that the very first submitted NBD patch was broken down [Andrew]
	2. that only 1 spinlock is used for all the NBD request_queue structures
	   used [Jens,Al]
	3. that kmap() is used in case of highmem pages [Jens]
	4. that the allocation of request_queue is dynamic and seperate from
	   other allocated objects [Al]

	[PATCH] Workqueue Exit Neatening
	
	Jeff Garzik points out the initializing the exit completion at
	exit time is foolish: we should just initialize it at creation time
	live everything else in that structure, and avoid the memory barrier.

<rmk@flint.arm.linux.org.uk>
	[PCMCIA] Fix ide-cs driver name (for PCMCIA binding)
	
	Problem noticed by Eivind Tagseth.
	
	We seem to have resurected the "ide_cs" driver name for the ide-cs module.
	Restore the driver name to "ide-cs".

	in non-hotplug kernel.
	
	Tested on Alpha.

	 - updated the dvr (digital videorecording) facility
	 - renamed some structures, like "struct dmxdev_s" to "struct dmxdev"
	 - introduced dvb_functions.[ch], where some linux-kernel specific
	   functions are encapsulated.  by this, the dvb subsystem stays quite
	   independent from deeper linux kernel functions.
	 - moved dvb_usercopy() to dvb_functions.c -- this is essentially
	   video_usercopy() which should be generic_usercopy() instead...
	 - Made the dvb-core in dvbdev.c work with devfs again.
	 - remove all typedefs from structs
	 - remove all typedefs from enums

<neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
	[PATCH] Include update mode in declaration of RPC information caches.
	
	The sunrpc/cache.c caches which store nfsd export information
	can be updated either "inplace" or by replacing the entry.
	
	replacement is needed when an entry hold a reference to some
	other object, so the reference counts work properly.
	
	"inplace" can be used when no such references are held, and should be
	used when the object could be refered to by another cache (as otherwise
	the other cache would have to be updated whenever this one is).
	
	Previously the type of update (inplace or replace) was specified
	as an argument to the *_lookup operation.  This too easily lead to
	inconsistancies.
	
	With this patch, the update mode is specified when the cache is
	declared.

<neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
	[PATCH] Add some tracing when showing the content of an RPC cache.

	[PATCH] enable local APIC on P4
	
	The current local APIC code refuses to enable the local APIC

	This patch removes this unnecessary restriction. Please apply.
	
	Most P4 machines do boot with the local APIC enabled, but
	Keith Owens reported that the P4 based Compaq Evo N800v
	disables the local APIC, even though the machine actually
	works if Linux enables it.
	
	It is possible that some P4 machines with broken BIOSen
	were saved by our refusal to enable the local APIC. We
	can handle them via the DMI blacklist rules instead.

	[PATCH] loop.c - part 2 of N
	
	This does the following:
	
	 - IV value is current 512-byte sector relative to start of loop
	   container file.  This is what all cryptoloop people have done, if I
	   am not mistaken.  Andi or others - if you can demonstrate the need
	   for a more flexible setup an additional ioctl field may be needed.  I
	   hope we can do without.
	
	 - made some things static
	
	 - made lo_offset a loff_t
	
	 - added lo_sizelimit
	
	   If one wanted a (crypto)loop somewhere inside a container file, the
	   old code allowed a starting offset, but no size, so that the
	   cryptoloop always extended to the end of the container file.  This
	   field allows one to select an arbitrary interval.  Note that this
	   changes struct loop_info64.
	
	 - improve error handling of loop_init()
	
	 - removed the unused typedef transfer_proc_t.
	
	 - added a define for LO_CRYPT_CRYPTOAPI

	[PATCH] unexpected IO-APIC update
	
	Recently there has been a rash of Unexpected IO APIC reports on the
	linux-smp mailing list.  Most of the most recent ones are due to some
	newer Intel chipsets (865, 875).
	
	The IO APIC Version register doesn't indicate the differences in these
	IO APICs.
	
	I have an patch that addresses these chipsets.  It has been tested by a
	few people with good results and has been blessed by Maciej Rozycki.
	
	Other than conditionally decoding IO APIC registers 2 and 3, we could
	alternately ignore them since Linux doesn't use the values for anything
	other than printing them.
	
	This patch ignores IO APIC register 2 if it's the same value as IO APIC
	register 1.  It also reads IO APIC register 3 if the IO APIC version is
	>= 0x20, but some chipsets don't support this register, so it is also
	ignored if its value if the same as IO APIC register 1 or 2.
	
	Another possible(?) alternative is to read the PID/VID of the device to
	determine which registers it supports.  However, PCI devices have not
	been scanned at this point in init, so it would require scanning PCI
	config space directly and I don't yet see the point of doing that.
	
	Oh, and the UNEXPECTED_IO_APIC() function doesn't print anything in
	2.5.current and I didn't change that.

<stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
	[PATCH] Fix scsi host attributes
	
	The shost_attrs stuff looks fine, expect for two points.
	
		1. The scsi_sysfs_modify_shost_attribute() and
	scsi_sysfs_modify_sdev_attribute() functions appear to be written a bit
	carelessly.  Below is a patch that: permits modification of the first
	attribute in the list, allocates a new list with entries having the
	correct size, copies the correct number of entries from the old list, and
	wraps excessively long source lines.
	
		2. More importantly, the current organization of the code has a
	serious problem.  The SCSI core does not modify the host driver when the
	reference count for either shost->class_dev or shost->host_gendev drops to
	0.  Without knowing that, it is unsafe for the driver ever to deallocate a
	private host data structure, since a user process may continue to hold a
	reference to an open attribute file indefinitely, even after
	scsi_unregister() has returned.

		- the task is running, but now it is no longer the highest
		  priority task on the rq
		- the task is not running, but now it is the highest
		  priority task on the rq
	
	In either case, we need to set need_resched to invoke the scheduler.

	[PATCH] AT_SECURE auxv entry
	
	From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
	
	This patch adds an AT_SECURE auxv entry to pass a boolean flag indicating
	whether "secure mode" should be enabled (i.e.  sanitize the environment,
	initial descriptors, etc) and allows each security module to specify the
	flag value via a new hook.
	
	New userland can then simply obey this flag when present rather than
	applying other methods of deciding (sample patch for glibc-2.3.2 can be
	found at http://www.cs.utah.edu/~sds/glibc-secureexec.patch).
	
	This change enables security modules like SELinux to request secure mode
	upon changes to other security attributes (e.g.  capabilities,
	roles/domains, etc) in addition to uid/gid changes or even to completely
	override the legacy logic.
	
	The legacy decision algorithm is preserved in the default hook functions
	for the dummy and capability security modules.
	
	Credit for the idea of adding an AT_SECURE auxv entry goes to Roland
	McGrath.

	[PATCH] get_unmapped_area() speedup
	
	From: Ingo Molnar
	
	Apparently our thread-creation performance has gone down the tubes again,
	because the mm.free_area_cache search heuristic broke.
	
	The initial, more naive hole-cache patch helped the testcode in the
	beginning.  Then after some point glibc started creating a 'small hole' in
	the vmas, which hole was _below_ the thread stacks, and which hole thus
	prevented the intended operation of the cache.
	
	The new code solves the problem by relaxing the 'smallest address hole cache'
	rule a bit, the cache is now not re-set at every get_unmapped_area() time,
	it's only re-set during unmaps.  It's also re-set if there are no allocatable
	mappings at all - ie.  correctness is not affected.

	[PATCH] dentry->d_count fixes: d_invalidate
	
	From: Maneesh Soni <maneesh@in.ibm.com>

<akpm@digeo.com>
	[PATCH] dentry->d_count fixes: nfs_unlink
	
	From: Maneesh Soni <maneesh@in.ibm.com>
	
	- nfs_unlink() can race with lockless d_lookup() as d_lookup() can
	  successfully lookup a dentry for which nfs_unlink() can assume that no one
	  else is using and can go ahead and do nfs_safe_remove() on it. By using
	  per dentry lock, it is solved as we d_lookup() will fail the lookup for
	  unhashed dentries.

<akpm@digeo.com>
	[PATCH] dentry->d_count fixes: hpfs
	
	From: Maneesh Soni <maneesh@in.ibm.com>
	
	- hpfs_unlink() can race with lockless d_lookup(), as we can have situations
	  where d_lookup() has successfully looked-up a dentry and at the sametime
	  hpfs_unlink()--->d_drop() has dropped it. Taking the per dentry lock
	  before checking the d_count in hpfs_unlink() solves this race condition.

	[PATCH] workaround for smb_proc_getattr oops
	
	From: Zwane Mwaikambo <zwane@linuxpower.ca>
	
	smbfs tends to oops over a null server->ops->getattr in smb_proc_getattr().
	
	Urban says:
	
	 In 2.5 the server->ops is initialized when smbfs gets a connection, to
	 match whatever the server is capable of or not. This happens after the
	 mount syscall so smbfs is then mounted but not usable.
	
	 Not sure if smb_lookup is always called before any other operation that
	 uses server->ops. If it is then it would be enough to have a test there.
	
	 Otherwise I will just change all users of server->ops to verify the
	 pointer first and return -EIO or something.
	
	Al Viro says (paraphrasing)
	
	 ugh, we need mount2().
	
	It doesn't look to me like we'll be getting mount2() in the 2.6 timeframe.
	Zwane's patch implement's Urban's workaround.

	[PATCH] normalise node load for NUMA
	
	From: Andrew Theurer <habanero@us.ibm.com>
	
	This patch ensures that when node loads are compared, the load value is
	normalised.  Without this, load balance across nodes of dissimilar cpu
	counts can cause unfairness and sometimes lower overall performance.
	
	For example, a 2 node system with 4 cpus in the first node and 2 cpus in
	the second.  A workload with 6 running tasks would have 3 tasks running on
	one node and 3 on the other, leaving one cpu idle in the first node and two
	tasks sharing a cpu in the second node.  The patch would ensure that 4
	tasks run in the first node and 2 in the second.
	
	I ran some kernel compiles comparing this patch on a 2 node 4 cpu/2 cpu
	system to show the benefits.  Without the patch I got 140 second elapsed
	time.  With the patch I get 132 seconds (6% better).
	
	Although it is not very common to have nodes with dissimilar cpu counts, it
	is already happening.  PPC64 systems with partitioning have this happen,
	and I expect it to be more common on ia32 as partitioning becomes more
	common.

	[PATCH] ext3: fix page lock vs journal_start ranking bug
	
	ext3_block_truncate_page() is calling grab_cache_page() inside a JBD
	transaction.  This is wrong, because transactions nest inside lock_page().
	
	The deadlock is against shrink_list->ext3_journalled_writepage->journal_start.
	
	This was not noticed before because we never used to journal writepage() data
	in journalled-data mode.  And because the deadlock against
	generic_file_write() is covered up by i_sem.
	
	Rework things so that we lock the page prior to starting a transaction.

<akpm@digeo.com>
	[PATCH] ext3: fix memory leak
	
	We need to unconditionally brelse() the buffer in there, because
	journal_remove_journal_head() leaves a ref behind.
	
	release_buffer_page() does that.  Call it all the time because we can usually
	strip the buffers and free the page even if it was not marked buffer_freed().
	
	Mainly affects data=journal mode

	[PATCH] use generic dma direction bits in scsi
	
	Make the *_data_direction flags of type enum dma_data_direction from
	the generic dma mapping API.  The SCSI_DATA_* defines are kept for
	compatiblity and map to the dma mapping API values now.
	scsi_to_pci_dma_dir and scsi_to_sbus_dma_dir are kept as stubs -
	we define them to nothing as both the PCI and SBUS constants have
	the same values as the generic dma mapping ones.  Unfortunately
	we can't check anymore whether someone messes this up as the values
	are enumes now and not cpp defines.

	From: Bob Miller <rem@osdl.org>
	
	Removed the check_mem_region() call and replaced with request_mem_region().
	
	Because of the way the driver is structured the first request_mem_region()
	call gets the default memory area.  After probing the complete memory area
	that is needed to communicate with the device is known, so the first memory
	area is released and the complete area is requested.

	[IPSEC] split xfrm_state_replace + fixes 
	
	Split xfrm_state_replace into xfrm_state_add and xfrm_state_replace.
	
	Fixes:
	1. Only update update lifetime and encap options if the state is valid.
	2. Disallow updates to states that do not exist.
	3. Bail if afinfo cannot be found.
	 
	This brings SADB_UPDATE in line with what is required by RFC2367.
	It is also needed by SFS NAT-T support as it needs to update valid
	states when the encap ports move.
	
	I've tweaked the logic slightly so that SADB_UPDATE will fail on a
	larval state that hasn't undergone SADB_GETSPI.  This is what RFC2367
	calls for and it simplifies the code in that we don't have to call
	find_acq for SADB_UPDATE.
	
	This doesn't affect any of the three KMs as they either don't use
	SADB_UPDATE or call SADB_GETSPI before doing an update.

	need to traverse the scatterlist.

	[PATCH] fix return value after hugetlb mmap failure
	
	At the moment no one uses is_aligned_hugepage_range or is_hugepage_only_range,
	but it is reasonable to assume they return true or false.
	
	On error we want to return -EINVAL back to userspace.

	[IPV6] Make ipsec tunnel work with ext hdrs
	
	I noticed that using extensions headers along with IPsecv6 tunnel mode did
	not work in 2.5.73 + patch-2.5.73-bk3. The following patch
	checks "nexthdr" instead of "iph->nexthdr" which could be an
	extension header. I tested this with tunnel mode and transport mode
	with and without extension headers and it worked ok.

<torvalds@home.osdl.org>
	Fix the code that checks for PCI IDE controller "native" vs "legacy"
	modes. 
	
	It used to think that IDE controllers that weren't marked as "IDE storage"
	PCI class (eg CMD IDE RAID controllers mark themselves as "RAID storage")
	were always using legacy mode interrupt routing, which is bogus. In fact,
	the whole native vs legacy thing only makes sense for the IDE storage class,
	so fix the test to match.

	[BRIDGE]: Ethernet bridge fixes.
	
		1. STP protocol has no security, so malcontents can fuck with the
		  bridge's topology.  The fixes are to ship with STP turned off
		  to protect the ignorant, and run STP packets through ebtables
		  netfilter for the smart.  
	
		  Got this one via a russian hacker "Oleg K. Artemjev" <olli@rbauto.ru>
		  before he published the paper.
		  Bridge netfilter still needs work to give a nice face on this
		  but this patch gives the hooks to filter.
	
		2. STP input processing was lax in it's length checking so I bet
		  you could make up a bomb packet.
	
		  My inspection while doing #1.
	
		3. Forwarding table could be abused by sending forged packets with
		   bogus source address same as the local host.  This came via
		   Lennart from Jerry Kreuscher <jerrykr@mindspring.com> who ran into
		   it by mistake.

	to tell MO drives from other drives (needed for later write support).

	dev->udev was set to NULL to indicate a device disconnect but we need

	delayed until skel_release().
	I've added a dev->present for preventing device read, write and ioctl.
